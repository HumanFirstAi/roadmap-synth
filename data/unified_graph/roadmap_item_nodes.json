But: - CPQ team is focused on complex (Next Gen CPQ, configurator, Deal Desk) - Catalog team is focused on complex (bundles for enterprise scenarios) - No product team owns the \"light\" end of the spectrum - EMEA sales explicitly needs simpler deployment, but roadmap doesn't address it **Root Cause:** Silver Lake mandate (\"B2B complex NOAM\") is being interpreted as \"only B2B complex.\" The vision says we need both, but resource allocation says we're choosing complex. **Recommended Resolution:** 1. Explicitly create \"Stage 1/Stage 2\" product owner (likely Acquisition team) 2. Define CPQ Light as real roadmap item, not just \"use Experiences to abstract CPQ\" 3.
