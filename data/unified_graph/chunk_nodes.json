I've got to write a strategy for this acquisition to order domain now, which is kind of, you know, acquisition to order, and then order to cash and and, as I said to you before, you have quite a broad view, which is both current and also you have history to it, right? So you understand, I don't know how much you've touched CPQ\n\nSpeaker 1  0:44 a lot, a lot. Okay, so\n\nSpeaker 2  0:47 the whole new cpqx thinking is actually mine. Okay, good.\n\nSpeaker 1  0:51 Well, that's I'm in the right place then. So my question is this, what we it would be an exercise in futility to kind of try and change the core road maps, right? We've got manfreds is baked in I'm speaking. Obviously there's some questions I've got around things like vibe quoting, and I think you and I talked about it. Errol's got his, you know, at stack ranked, very precise merchandising objectives, BC, you know, I'm still talking about BCS and zems and this kind of stuff. So I\n\nSpeaker 2  1:23 feel they're part of 80. Yeah, they're part of the 80, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  1:27 Okay. I mean, it's a big list for a small engineering team, although there's some new engineers going to come into that team. But it's kind of you've got, what you don't want to do is get your fingers into those. There's subtle ways to change the stack ranking within those things. But at the core t",

But in my, in my thinking, there's this kind of Venn Diagram of where these things intersect. And in my mind, the intersection is where the broader story takes place, right? So if I go to market and I say, well, kind of CP, you know, they're not interested in the capabilities necessarily, of catalogue or the capabilities of CPQ, it's at the edges, like, how do these things build capability, platform capability, to Pete's point about, you know, being able to deploy easily these systems join up, etc, etc. So I kind of thinking, I think of the intersections as the scaffolding around the product roadmaps, right? So you have these product roadmaps, and then at the edges, there's this scaffolding. And it feels to me like engineering architecture is where a lot of this scaffolding lives, right? So how does CPQ use catalogue when you talk about vibe quoting? How do you bring compliance into vibe quoting so that it's actually fit for purpose. You know, where we think about experiences? How are we thinking about those experiences being accessible to businesses that don't want to use separate and have their own orchestration management out there? You know, what's the surface area? So my question to you, and I apologise that it's a broad question, but how do you think about what is the way that we should think about approaching that problem? Because I think you've mentioned it a few times. You've gone these teams just don't speak to each other, right? Like there's not a lot of coordination across the business, and I feel like there should be, but I want to first understand why there isn't, and what your thinking is. So I'm going to pause, why\n\nSpeaker 2  3:53 doesn't matter, Jonathan, why doesn't matter because\n\nSpeaker 2  3:58 different different priorities and different motivations will lead to this behaviour. The question over here should rather be, what do we need to do to force the alignment, to force the alignment in a way that they see that the incentive comes if we achieve it together, not that I achieved my roadmap, and then others need to follow. And it's not just this problem localised over here, in my view. And I, I say that all the time, but I'm, I'm happy to concede, if people feel I'm wrong, it's a Zora wide problem across all the product orgs. It is not just these two little things. You talk about, commerce going out all the way to the orders, same problem. Commerce all the way out to the rating, same problem. So it's not that. But what I'm trying to, I was, why I pulled ou",

We come to 2010, five, and then to the ground right. Now, what happens is like, let's, let's do this. So for example, I have experience. Experience is my product display pages, my God, experience and what have you okay. Now this guy will, in some shape, way, form, talk to the catalogue. Okay. Catalogue needs to take input from my rules and constraints, which we keep on calling merchandising rules and what have you. I don't care what the name we use, so it needs to take inputs from this, okay? Because, in my opinion, catalogue is just catalogue. What do you sell and how do you sell? The constraints and rules are overarching commerce constraints and rules. Okay, now here I get something which I call sales motion, sales motion or GTM flows your experience, takes input from this. It should be the other way. It should not be this way. So consider this your sales rules, or go or guided selling rules, and what have you. Okay. Now, if I keep on moving somewhere here, I'm going to have come on over here. I'm going to copy this over here, somewhere here. I'm going to have pricing engine and reading. Okay, so this guy ultimately feeds here, yeah, catalogue feeds here. And ultimately this guy also talked to this guy because I have to do karting and experiences as well. Why do\n\nSpeaker 2  7:07 great. Okay, now you're going to build other applications behind it. Let's say I build my coding application, loading right coding ultimately talks to catalogue as well. Why? Because of this configuration, good, okay, and I keep on going from here on right. But if I break coding down, what is it that coding needs? Let's break it down. Coding needs list of product\n\nSpeaker 2  7:54 colours. Let's do this way. This is better.\n\nSpeaker 2  8:17 And some basic obvious things, which is\n\nSpeaker 2  8:26 PDF chain, and all that, PDF chain, etc. And then you got guided selling flows.\n\nSpeaker 2  8:37 Now let's try to rationalise from this. What are the common elements? If I look at the common elements, I need to know, products, plans, prices, price evaluation, rules and constraints, widgets for commerce, experience, which is car. Let's just make it smaller.\n\nSpeaker 2  9:09\n\nDots, browsing, etc, etc,\n\nSpeaker 2  9:12 where I'm going with this. You got only a bunch of handful of functionalities here, prices, entitlements, right? How do we enforce entitlement? Is a completely different thing. Probably not. Should not be here. That's a different thing. That's a more on the edge kind of or a self bound system where fulfilment happens or entitlements happens on the check happens on the other side. But if I tie everything like this, you will invariably find there are synergies between coding and experience. You will invariably find that I cannot do anything in catalogue without pricing engine being influenced. Pricing engine needs to work with rules and constraints. And how are we thinking in tomorrow's world where I'm going to have so many, this is my philosophy. I'm going to have so many front ends where commerce is going to happen that my widgets probably are not going to be needed. Commerce is probably going to happen through chat, GPT ap",

Maybe I'll make some money and be sticky for that, and then I can evolve. But then the question is, whatever I'm doing here, how do I use it here? If I'm doing vibe coating here, why am I not doing vibe widgets that are actually usable here? So there is a whole lot of synergy. When I think about it, I elevate myself, and I take a 30,000 foot balcony view. And I'm like, we are pumping engineers in so many directions, and ultimately I can rationalise them together. I can contextualise what they need to do. Say the experience is going to be this, while coding experience is defined by one person and one person, that's it, and then coating can modify that, or catalogue can modify that. What is the difference? The difference is persona. If I as a customer go in, I do not see a lot many features. I do not see that I can modify things. If I go in as a salesperson, I get more tooling. Sure, this is like 20 years old or 10 year old software where permission driven experiences have been done, that's the same thing that we need to do, but since we are running in parallel paths, I believe we haven't thought of rationalisation rules and constraints. I started talking about it eight months ago, that I want one commerce rules engine. When I say one commerce rule engine, one commerce rules owner that caters to CPQ and that caters to your catalogue, B to C. Commerce, if so, be it or Subscriber Portal or what have you, it should not be too.\n\nSpeaker 1  11:50 Yeah. So you and I are completely aligned, right? I think exactly the way my diagram is a Venn diagram with the intersections pretty similar to yours. I this, you talk about 30,000 foot I think of it like a sandwich. You know, the top layer the bread is the story. Underneath is the engineering. You've talked about the story of the engineering in the middle is the product. You know, is it lettuce, tomato, cheese, and whatever you synthesise the product requirements with, with the view of the story and the engineering partners, right? So that that's, I don't believe, starting from the middle and working out. I think you start with the principles, 30,000 foot engineering capability, what you've just talked about in the working so we 100% aligned. There's a couple of things I had to ask you, price, pricing, engine, rating, what I mean I understand merchandising, so I'm trying to synthesise a lot of what Errol's documentation tells me into something that I can understand a bit better. So rules and constraints is, is what he calls merchandising. Where is, what is pricing engine and rating in your language or in his language? Where's the join in that? So the price waterfall he talks about,\n\nSpeaker 2  13:09 no. So okay, this is where\n\nSpeaker 2  13:13 whatever I'm explaining to you is exactly what I've been explaining to Errol ever since he has been on board. Right? He does have his choice of words, yeah, right. Waterfall is an outcome, okay, price waterfall is and I told him as well, price waterfall is not a feature. It's an outcome. Yeah? And it should be a no brainer. What is it? Basically, I have I'm building a cart. While building a cart, some of my rules and constraints are gonna get triggered, yeah, or maybe some of my deterministic constraints are gonna get triggered, which are ways, basically hard coded. You buy this, you get 10% discount, okay, yeah. The outcome of, how did I arrive at t",

    "content": "e final card that I'm going to check out is price waterfall, yeah, okay, good outcome. But who, how do I get there? I get there with these and these, because pricing engine is the evaluation engine that knows how to interpret discounts, that knows how to handle billing period, how to handle, you know, leap years, those kind of rules, all of those things pricing engine knows, has that been\n\nSpeaker 1  14:18 charge model, but the waterfall as the as the outcome the engine is exists, whatever. So yes or no,\n\nSpeaker 2  14:27 engine exists, but engine will have to be enhanced. We cannot support everything today that we need to do. So, for example, if you go to the engine and say, Dude, how did you calculate? Engine? Won't tell you that today. Engine says, I know I calculated it right, take it and show to the customer, but he's like, No, show me proof of work. Engine doesn't have it. So rather than me building pricing waterfall in commerce, I would rather put it in the pricing engine and rating and say everyone has access to it. Now, okay,\n\nSpeaker 1  14:56 all right, so you and I are completely aligned.\n\nSpeaker 1  15:00 I agree with you that why doesn't matter. Where I disagree with you is that creating a holistic vision that people will buy into will work, right, to be completely transparent. You know, Errol has a very baked view of what he wants to do, right? I think it's an exercise in futility at this stage to try and unpick what Errol wants to do. It's a case of looking at the road map which makes sense, and letting him execute it at the level of granularity that he wants, RIGHT? Jimmy, also, again, I'm being completely transparent with you, Jimmy. I don't know how much time you spent with Jimmy.\n\nSpeaker 1  15:45\n\nYou have a lot,\n\nSpeaker 2  15:46 so a reasonable amount to understand that he is like at this stage where we are not moving. I just need to move,\n\nSpeaker 1  15:54 yeah, exactly, exactly, yeah, which is, which is risky, because I have to have a high degree of trust in that. That's the direction you're going with. I'm not going to move. Jimmy hates being challenged, which is just a natural process of product conceptualization and internalisation, you know, open debate, push back challenge, but it's kind of I have to get to that point. Well, yeah, but when you get to that point and it's wrong, you know, I'm the person that let you get to that point now, right? So, so I saw, so that's, that's a, you know, he's young, so he kind of, and he comes from GS, so that's probably kind of baked into his\n\nSpeaker 2  16:35 DNA, right? Yeah, my, my solution is what I'm going to, I'm\n\nSpeaker 1  16:39 going with that, right? And when you ask me why it's like, because that's what I told you I'm doing. So not really, but anyway, that's my problem. Manfred, on the other side is, is quite open and collaborative, and you know, he, he is interested in opinions, but on the other side, he gets, can get forced in a direction, right? You know, external influence comes and says, Hey, we're going to go in that direction. He's like, Yeah, okay, let's go in. How fast you want to go? So I my relationship with Manfred Jimmy, and they're all very different. Alex and Sean on the other side of Zephyr, you know, trying to, they're trying to internalise where they are in the stack. And so there's a lot of things there, and then there's that, right? So we so my point is that trying to manage all of those different personalities feels very challenging to get to move them in a direction, right? It takes time. It takes time, but, but what I do have, and I said this before, is I have people like you who share the problem statement, right, and, and what I'm trying to work out is it is much easier to say, Listen, the strategy is a single thing, which means that as a forcing function, that single thing has to do this across these things that is bought into engineering and product leadership, and therefore, this is The this is the thing we have to now cater",

And I've seen with we had quite an uncomfortable conversation between on the experiences side, with Alan and Alex and Sean and Jimmy and Taylor and and Errol. And what was interesting? So I know this is long narrative, what was interesting about that is that we largely came to the direction that Errol and Jimmy wanted to go in, but everyone understood and had internalised what that meant. It was a it was a share. Instead of, hey, go read the 80 page documentation that I wrote, and read the 65 JIRAs that are, which no one's ever going to do, people began to say, okay, I can, I can kind of get where these guys are coming from now, and we have a shared vision and and we can talk about that separately. So my question to you is, if we accept certain inevitables, that you're not going to change Jimmy or Errol or make Manfred less malleable and all this kind of stuff, and that these are good, thoughtful people who understand with good intent what their products should do, where do we focus on the intersection as an as an art, because it's an architectural principle. So that's what I'm asking now.\n\nSpeaker 2  19:48 So when I say these things, I mean, you can always probably assume that I'm always aware of the practicality of this and the reality that people will have to execute. I'm never saying that we got to stop them. Let them execute. Let's help them as well. But you have to decide what is the core forum which you need to establish so that and set a timeline. Hypothetically, let's say first week of January. We should have a holistic vision of Zora commerce and orders. And CPQ is part of commerce by first week of January. Whoever that is, okay. Now we have taken and synthesised the inputs from various sources. Magnifit is a source. Errol is a source. Jimmy is a source. But if you feel that they're going to come there and say, no, no, no, no. Why are you disrupting it? We are not disrupting we are helping you in moving on your individual goals whilst accepting or trying to change whatever we can in that little window, we set ourselves a target. This is how at least my brain works and how I used to we set ourselves a target that first of March, that vision and that execution plan is open to everyone. In that execution plan will be things you are doing, and we won't touch things we are doing. We will rationalise things we are doing that are deprioritized. Rationalising means, hey, this guy wanted it. This guy wanted it. We are going to change, evolve, but you'll get the outcome. I think the motivation has to be about the outcome and not execution. And I do not feel if I take a union of all the outcomes that are wanted, then we will be very far off a strategic architecture that we want out as well, or that I want out as well, or you want as well, and seeing that you are very much aligned with how we are very much aligned with how we think that union is not something that has come out in the open and people are afraid, because the moment you put energy into unioning and rationalising, you lose time. So separate out the execution team from the thinking team, and thinking team then can come to the execution team and say, throw darts at me. Let me tell you how I'm still going to achieve the outcome, and then we refine it so it has matured to a degree where thinking team doesn't feel I've been completely sidelined. But at the same time, not everyone is in the same discussion. Because everyone in the same discussion means it is absolutely a recipe for you heading to a derailment. Yeah. Now that's how, at least, I think once that is to a point where people see, yeah, I'm getting everything. But who's doing it is changing, or how we are approaching it is changing, the outcome is there. I think people will native, naturally buy in.\n\nSpeaker 1  22:42 I agree. I agree.

    "content": " though, right? So there's a psychology here. But the way you've, you know, I completely buy into that. I mean, I think the what is sensitive about that is that you say, Listen, there is an architectural principle here, right? I'm the head of architecture, there's an architectural principle. I have an objective. As a product leader or product multiple product owner, I also share that objective, right? It has both. It has both a qualitative value in that people unify across a message. It's not just a project, right? They understand what the total goal is. The value of that is, if the project lead, product leaders, can understand that, the market can at the field, can understand that, and the analysts will understand that, right? And Silver Lake will understand that, right? So there's that. That's the top piece of the sandwich. I like the idea, you know, I you, when you do this kind of thing, you need a safe place. And I think the safe place is architectural principles, right? What are we trying to do as a business? And if I go to Pete and Shakir and say, Listen, nav, and I seem to have a shit, we come at this from completely different lenses. We've not, we've not aligned on this. We were aligned from the beginning. And we have an architect, we have both a product and an architectural principle, which is this, I don't think Shakir or Pete are going to even bat an eyelid. They're going to say, Absolutely, that's the way to go. Now my question to you is, again, throwing darts at the idea, and because we can talk about how we get there, this, to me, feels like it's obvious and so what? And it's, again, this is not a criticism of Pete or Shakir. Why do you think this has not happened?\n\nSpeaker 2  24:30 I knew you would ask it. I knew that's where you were going. That's why I had the answer already. Thought of I was just waiting for you to ask because I didn't\n\nSpeaker 1  24:41 want don't make it don't make it so obvious. Now, at least Throw me a bone. Man, Throw me a bone.\n\nSpeaker 2  24:45 Yeah, no, it is. So I'll tell you why it happened.\n\nSpeaker 2  24:50 Manfred and Errol, they joined at different times. Okay, Errol joined. He had me. I could give him a brain dump. And even then, to come to the point that guys, entitlement is very important. Took him a year ask him, and I'm hoping he'll acknowledge that yes, I told nav, entitlements is not important. Don't focus on that. And now I'm saying yes, it is important. Right to focus on integration of entitlement to metering, because we are getting challenges from the customer. How do you do quota based entitlements? If you don't have metering in there, should I develop me ring? But why should i i have metering already? So bringing the team together has its own cost to it. It's a tax, organisational tax you pay. Then comes Manfred. Manfred's goal was, let me take CPQ further, and I've tried to bring them together all the times. I've tried to mediate it. Because Manfred is like, I got a rule engine. I'm like, No, hang on. You need an outcome, an outcome from the rule engine. Commerce needs an outcome from the rule engine. Do not associate with rule engine. You associate yourself with an outcome, and then you associate with the NFRs. I can give you like a human who's responding from the back, you should be fine with that if I meet your requirements. Of course, there's an elegance in architecture. We'll talk about that. But I think people don't align, because inherently, when Manfred came his his reward function was different. Errol's reward function is super different. They collide and Manfred built his roadmap. Errol built his roadmap. The goal is not, let's come up with a commerce roadmap, because they did not. And shaker is great in so many things, but one thing that Shakir didn't see is this, right? He cannot be in deeper. He's in so many places that he did not have. He does not have time to unify these things. So when Manfred and Errol talk, or Manfred and Errol talk, they what do they talk about? They talk about dependencies. I want to, yeah, that's a big deal. Talk about, let's talk about the outcome. Yeah, that's\n\nSpeaker 1  26:55 so true. It's always a friction point of dependencies. You haven't given me the dependencies instead of what is the outcome we're looking to achieve, and how do we Yeah, okay, so let me ask you a question then. So again, I like to try and navigate around. What's it? Just\n\nSpeaker 2  27:15 one more. One more statement. Yeah. I could have been more effective. I have been trying to push it as well, and I have gotten wins. For example, pulling rules out away from Manfred and Errol has been a win. There are a bunch of other wins as well that I got on the way. But until and unless my product counterparts do not align and don't see value in it, I will always struggle, because they get their last say, they will say yes. Now your architecture is elegant, but I got to deliver, mate, and I got to deliver tomorrow, and then I have to sit\n\nSpeake",

Now finally, you can have one vision, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 1  27:56 exactly, and that there's a there's a nuance to how this all gets done, which I think you have a sensitivity to, which is what I like, right? It's not just like, are we going to force them to do this? There is a there is a human component to this. So my question is, this, in these intersections, it feels like, so, so the eye. So if you take the core catalogue, which is Errol's domain, right? And this idea of rules, you know, cascading rules and chaining, and, you know, he keeps talking about multi arm bandit and all that kind of stuff. Do you to me, it feels like what you have to do is, you have to say, Listen, this is and again, if we accept our own principles. This is the core catalogue work, right? That team needs to deliver that thing. But at the intersection there's this other thing, where there are, there are these, these cross functional requirements, right? Then, dependencies, whatever you want to call them. It feels like you abstract those out, right? You say, Okay, listen, we understand the needs of here. We understand the needs of here. This thing is a, I know, if you call it a micro service, or it's a whatever that is, it does this thing. And as you say, Errol, it's going to give you your outcome. And, Manfred, it's going to give you your outcome. You are stakeholders in this, right? So your input is absolutely essential, but, and it's the execution and the thinking team motion that you talked about so, so on my list of things like zems, right? BCS, you know, these feel like external services. You're saying that price, the rules engine, is an\n\nSpeaker 2  29:45 rules and constraint and pricing in general,\n\nSpeaker 1  29:48 also, right? Okay, let's think\n\nSpeaker 2  29:51 of it as a commerce, as a platform, and then commerce applications,\n\nSpeaker 1  29:55 and then got enormous applications, okay? And then those things would be exposed internally. They could be exposed externally. All right, my question to you is, then, I mean, there's a lot of distance between that, that objective, and actually getting, all, you know, the buy in from from the product teams. How would you, or let me ask you a different question, what's your muscle in this right, in your role? What? What are you tasked with delivering? Is it delivering extensibility, logical architecture, reusable applications across multiple products, teams? What is what is Pete tasked you with three\n\nSpeaker 2  30:42 things, one, which is the foremost is when we go in front of the analysts, and if we go in front of the customers, we could expose how our product is built. And we can stand the test of everyone and say, so there is no need for me to worry that whatever the channel be, Zodiac supports everything the same way the logic is in one place, basically the proof that the brain is consolidated. If CPQ uses a different brain, catalogue uses a different brain, people are going to have different problems. That means never be a true omni channel. That is one thing. Second is scalability and removing the biases out of the architectural choices. Biases are. I am an engineer. I've been doing certain things certain way. I'm a PM, doing certain things certain way. I can keep on putting things on top of it, rather than using something that others can do or will do, that ideally should give me velocity. But we kind of fall in the trap of feeling, if I do it, I'll do it faster, and I'll be done with it for then, for that little time, time slice, it gives me velocity. But for, you know, delta t, large enough on an enterprise scale, that velocity comes down, because as the time passes, you realise that others have done something that I'll have to repeat. And that\n\nSpeaker 2  32:20 is how it is how it is that is absolutely the truth and auditabilit",

And the third principle is, how do we build an architecture for future with an eye that tomorrow we're going to need to do this, and we are not having to redo in Zora, we redo bunch of things.\n\nSpeaker 1  32:35 So this is square in your wheel. This is square in your wheelhouse. What talking seems to be your job description.\n\nSpeaker 2  32:44 This is actually my job description, but me and adult talking was also part of job description. But that time I was doing a job, and I'm so happy to to find you in that, because that was your role. I'll tell you why I said that this was my job. But convincing Errol, or convincing Manfred to come together and talk, and then convincing her that let's go to orders team or rating team and then talk together. Sounded like, Okay, I am investing too much in that space. And I know Errol wants to move forward. His intent is right, and he has been burnt out by oh, these guys are not going to help. They don't understand it. But when you have one person at the top, that person like, will they work with you? Will they not work with you? Is not your thought process. It's my job to make them work correct and right. I do not have an authority on them. I have an influence on them. You have an authority. It's a very different thing,\n\nSpeaker 1  33:38 totally Well, you're a mediator, a broker, right? But the thing is, is that my I am, I need, I said this last week, is that you need partners in this journey, right? So, for example, what is very straightforward for Errol to do is to say, I've been in pricing for 30 years, right? I know what. I know what should happen, right? So I go, okay, that's fine. I spoke to him the other day. He's been talking about the catalogue. He then says, actually, the catalogue is not that great because of backwards compatibility. The real thing we should be focusing on is the commerce experience around it, right? That all the capabilities around that that's fine. I get that. That makes perfect sense to me. Manfred, I spoke to about vibe quoting, and I said, Look, you know, I don't know as much about CPQ as you do, but it seems to me that the compliance is pretty high on the list of things that CPQ needs to do, right? Can you just tell me, at that last phase when you vibe quoted out a quote, where's the when someone clicks, that's my vibe quote, are they just going to get a computer says no, because it runs a bunch of compliance in the back end, and then says, Hey, no, you can't that all that vibe quoting you just did is not compliant, which means a really bad experience, and what I learned was, is that compliance is not even baked in to write quotes.\n\nSpeaker 2  35:06 Have you seen this thing that I did, although I got thrown out of the room for that, but I still am fairly proud of that.\n\nSpeaker 2  35:21 And I presented, these are the things that people were like, Oh no, this is a lot. I'm like, You can't live without that, so I'm not dictating that how we pre code binary. This is a binary. Why is this a binary? I so when I presented adaptive coding, yes, this is just a prototype I did just to explain my concept. Are\n\nSpeaker 1  35:51 you sharing your screen? I'm sorry I thought the\n\nSpeaker 2  35:55 whiteboard would shift to this. So this is what I presented to these guys, that this is what I want. Yeah, you go in. Here you go in. Here you have some precedent, and hence the probability of how quickly I can get approved, or will I get approved or not. Now, what's happening here is you quickly get all the compliance over here that what are the rules I had laid out, what are the priorities and what is the risk and how much I know it'll match if I push through this. Yeah, right. So this was just a concept that I was saying that, for example, if I say at 20% discount, 20% discount to all line items, there you go. Yeah, right, yeah. Cool. So now it just gives me an alert. You got to consider applying some repairs, because something has changed, some discount or band has changed, whatever it is, right? The point was, this was not accepted. This was like, this is now we don't need it. We just need a code. And then you put it in CPQ. CPQ will run all the compliance I'm like, that is basically you are making it much longer for me to get to where I want to be. So don't, don't do that to me. I won't like it that you tell me, Hey, push it to publish it to CPQ. Then in CPQ you have a bunch of alerts.\n\nSpeaker 1  37:17 That's a bad experience, because it's like, what happens in you in UX land, I click, I spend a lot of time doing that thing right, unless in line the compliance is being calculated. When I click publish and it goes to CPQ, what I have to click, keep clicking publish to get it's like, it's like, whack a mow. You know, it's like, I'm gonna whack that one over there. I'm gonna whack that one over there. Yeah, that doesn't seem logical to me.\n\nSpeaker 2  37:46 Yeah. I mean, they not continue back and fo",

I'm like, by the time they're gonna clean it up,\n\nSpeaker 1  37:58 might as well quoted it out formally. Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2  38:03 I have to pick up a phone call to Jonathan and say, Jonathan, I changed your code. You were expecting an ACV of 180k I cannot give you that it's going to be 140k\n\nSpeaker 1  38:12 because the salesman needs to do all of that, not the of course. Okay, so, yes, that's a different battle. I suspect that's driven by team, you know, that is driven by, yeah, he wants something up and quick. And then, you know, the UX, the detail, that last mile that breaks everything, that that's where the that's where the margin of performance is.\n\nSpeaker 2  38:34 And I think his philosophy is, let me get something up quick and dirty. That's okay, and then I'll back them. Everyone that customer is asking, Do it? Do it. Do it. That's not how I feel. That's one of the reason why I was told, now we need you away from CPQ. Now in the very polite way, I could see that, because I was like, No, don't do this.\n\nSpeaker 1  38:57 Listen, I don't know CPQ. And I came to that conclusion in 10 seconds. Yeah, right. Is like it's that's a really bad engineering pattern to get into. In my view,\n\nSpeaker 2  39:07 you can do wipe coding with chat GPT today. I can do wipe coding, and I can actually what I need. I need a DSL of Zora, all the structure of Zora, which, by the way, my charge GPT instance knows. And I can literally quickly say, start building a code. It will build a code. It will do goals. I don't need anything. What's important is the rules that are in your business that I need to learn from and enforce. The compliance is what will sell. Nobody will buy my tool without\n\nSpeaker 1  39:36 that, you have to buy. You have to bake it in at the root, right at the root of that five quoting. The other thing is, is what it also misses. And I've been back testing this with Errol and other people who know CPQ. What CPQ doesn't capture is any of the behavioural dynamics. I think I mentioned it, or may or may not mentioned it. If I sell you 100 seats knowing that the utilisation is 65% across these features on those 100 seats, and then 30 of those seats have got low. So if you, if you think about that, whether or not that becomes a capability, if you don't bake it in, in the same pattern at the time of the quote, right? That's that you okay, there's really high utilisation over there. What would happen if I actually didn't discount the highly utilised seats as much as I discounted the low utilised seats, unless that's baked in at the vibe, the validation, it becomes just, it's just a front end thing, right? It's like, it doesn't become any All right? So again, there's not much. I think I remember the first days that you and I met with each other. There wasn't much daylight between you and I. So I think that's a we have to use that, because I also feel, even if we disagree, we'll be able to get to a really logical outcome. Because I'm not baked in stone, and I don't think you're baked in stone, right. There's kind of let me hear the let me hear why this is going to work. So my right in my my presentation is going to be all about the edges. It's like the principle that I talked about, but I think it has to have a point of view. And the point of view is that, My bet is around the architecture, that the things that you're being asked to do. My bet is it's at the edges, and the edges doesn't touch the road map. It creates the scaffolding around the road maps, and it and it builds concepts where we look at the join and we look at the abstraction, and we look at the analysts, and I'll speak to Maria, and I want to speak to the sales teams. And also, the other thing that it does now is this, at the top Silver Lake want B to B, right? Complex SaaS. But when you go down to the organisation, they don't want B to B, complex sauce. What they want is B to C, B to B, pl, G, B, to be kind of complex, but not so complex, very complex. It's like a whole smorgasbord at the bottom that what you're talking about when you think about these this application concept is where the pick and mix comes in, right? And when you go to analysts and you say, Listen, centralised applications, use cases are defined by what piece of the organisation you touch, but the engine underneath\n\nSpeaker 2  42:34 that's that's the thing. Okay, so I'll tell you my struggle. What I'm struggling with. I this is 100% when you say scaffolding, basically, in other words, you're saying you still get the same outcome that you are looking for. Don't, don't think that I'm here to disrupt you, but we are going to structure it in a way that maybe you're doing what you're doing right now. In two months, you will feel a little bit of changes, but six months down, you're going to be like now, it's just smooth. Everything is there. I just have to pick and",

When I talk to people, everybody is all about timeline and I need to deliver it tomorrow. Nobody is about this core. And I fed this back to Peter as well, to Shakira as well, move as well. In my experience, Shakir has come back to me. Navia customers are asking for, I cannot stop it. Okay with like, whatever pm says, I'm doing it. I'm like, I\n\nSpeaker 1  43:41 had a situation the other day now where someone said to me, Toyota needs experiences, and it's a $300,000 deal. And if we don't build my account, then we will not get experience. We will not get the $300,000 deal. So I thought that's kind of interesting. So I go to the CS org and the AE and the solution consultants, and it's not that what they want is a slightly more configurable payment form that they can send out to the customer, for the customer to buy the like, so that there's, it's all at the edges, right? It's all it's all in the nuance. And I validate always right? I never trust. I always validate. I hear what you're saying, but I need to validate that that drives people. It drives Errol fucking nuts. He hates that, right? That I did not just trust. So anyway, I have to make a bet. Right? My bet is what I talked about at the beginning. The story is the field wants 50 million to a billion vendor for life, right? They want to be able to compete with stripe. They want light CPQ. They want light billing. They want basically, they want the customer to know that in three years they're not going to have to rip out their billing system. You know, they want to go and say, Listen, don't go with stripe. If you go with stripe, you're gonna have to rip out your billing system in three years time. If you really going to grow the way you want to grow CPQ doesn't cater. You're gonna have to stitch it together. You don't, by the way, you don't need full CPQ. You need, like, a simpler CPQ. Here we're going to give you a transitional architecture right now. To get a transitional architecture, you need exactly what you're describing. So my, my story is on the top is vendor for life. Why vendor for life? The analysts want it, right? Yeah, not, not. Vendor for everything that's different. No, everything. Vendor for life in our space,\n\nSpeaker 2  45:43 in the funnel, yeah, after we drop through the funnel, then you are dropping this whole framework of wonderful life. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  45:49 And there's a I need to talk to you about Zephyr and rules, engine and journey orchestration and what the differences are. But that's probably for another call I might try and get you before Thanksgiving, if, if you got time, yeah. But that there's a benefit. So this is what the analysts want, what the field want, what the PM, team, product marketing managers want up there. Then there's this guy over here who wants an art who's been tasked with unified architecture, like, you know, good core principles,\n\nSpeaker 1  46:25\n\ncombined services,\n\nSpeaker 1  46:29 roadmaps that can still run fast, but using shared architecture or shared principles, all of that kind of stuff. And I buy that I'm buying what nav is selling right now, if Shakir, but if Shakir and Pete come, want to come back to me and say no, right? Then, then I'll go, Well, I'm buying what now selling. You got the wrong guy in the job, right? I believe in that. I'm not going to\n\nSpeaker 2  46:55 do anything. I'm not having a problem. Okay? Pete wants it, but Pete is informed by Shakir and Moo, if Shakira and Moo say, this will delay our delivery to Twilio trade, web, these kind of things. Then Pete will come to me and say, Now, can we just do something here? That's why I keep on saying. I have never said we do not focus on immediate, but you don't lose your future for the for the present, and just you have to continue to build future. And I believe what we're doing right now actually questions ",

One of the decision that I probably should have stuck to is building out catalogue features, rather than catalogue as a service, which Pete and then were 100% like? No, we want a separate service. We need to prove that we can do modularization. We did it. I'm not against that. We didn't, but one of the principle in there, which we had to follow was backward compatibility.\n\nSpeaker 1  47:57 Yeah, that that's limited. The category\n\nSpeaker 2  48:02 compromised so many things. Yeah, exactly, yeah. But, anyway,\n\nSpeaker 1  48:06 no, no, I agree with you, and I've heard that and so but I think, I think the only way to do this is say, Listen, Pete, this wouldn't be explicit. This kind of Pete, you put this guy in charge of doing these three things, right? That's the architectural principles the field over here wants the same thing, but just represented in a different way, right? But we can't go in and change the product roadmaps. The product roadmaps are baked. They've got, you know, tdds and designed and story points. That's fine, but there are the edges, the edges of the story, right? The connections, the intersections, are the story. That's where we become platform, right? So I'm going to make that bet\n\nSpeaker 2  48:50 exactly that that is the keyboard, that's where we become the platform. Yeah, yes. So\n\nSpeaker 1  48:54 I'm going to make that bet. I'm going to make that better so I'm actually happy. I'm going to step up in front of everyone on the, on the, whatever it is. And I'm going to leave Errol to do this roadmap, and I'll leave Manfred to do his roadmap. But I am going to present this. I'm going to tell them it's coming, so that they're not side, you know, blindsided. I'm bringing them on stage because I want them to have a voice about their own roadmaps. I don't just own it. Oh, this guy's coming in. He so I say we've got 10 minutes for Rome at 10, whatever. But then my pitch is going to be, I'm lining up with NAV because I believe in that, right? So that gives you now I think I've spoken to Ken about that. Ken is lined up on a joined up story because he wants to bring payments in to that story, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  49:47 Should be, yeah, okay, that's an order. Are you owning orders as well, or is it? No, that's Ken. Okay, so orders will line up with this as well, because our orders are not amazing, but it's okay. We can work through that.\n\nSpeaker 1  50:00 But I think Ken, I pitched it to Ken, and he said, Absolutely, that's, that's the story he wants to tell. He's the idea of vendor for life. He calls it forever vendor. I call it vendor for life, but that's the story. So I'm going to tell, I'm doing the due diligence with Emmy Paolo, Mark gagne, Steve Boone, you know, I'm building that story up there. I know where you and I line up. And in the middle, we have to do is take out the cheese, take out the tomato, and then, yes, yeah, okay, well, that's what\n\nSpeaker 2  50:30 we're gonna I'm very comfortable with that. And as I said, my struggle, and Pete knows this as well, is finding the champions in the product, or through whom I can or through, you know, those people I can drive it, I've been able to drive it in bits and pieces, but that's aligning to their incentive, yeah, not aligning to broader reward. So our incentive and reward functions are narrow, because I need to deliver my roadmap. But this is music to my ear, what you just said, because that way I feel like now we can start talking. And guess what? When we are getting to an outcome, people will see they would be resistant, but people will see, oh, not a lot is changing. It's changing how we think and how we approach and how much patience we need before me jumping into I need it tomorrow, like some things need to be baked. That's all I'm asking. I'm not asking Errol to throw away his road map. By no means. I'm saying, let's shape it up. Let's shape it up how we're going to build these pieces. You may have to reorg some pieces, Errol, you don't have rule engine. I'm going to give it to someone else, which is the platform for commerce.\n\nSpeaker 1  51:36 It's music to my ears, because I need, I need, I need a technical partner. These things are not achieved independently. They have to be stories have to be built. So we're going to do this all right, so I'm going to be that champion. I believe 100% in the in the strategy, it lines up right the way through the org. And the only people we have to move slightly is, in fact, I don't think Manfred is going to have a problem. I think the only all that is has a problem is experiences and catalogue, right? But\n\nSpeaker 2  52:05 we'll have to rethink a little bit by forming a story that if the architecture is this, I want people to own components of the architecture itself.

Because we've been and when I'm being a bit disingenuous to myself, when I say that I don't know how to do it. We are. We have looked at the services. We've looked at the architecture that can enable this. Now nav comes to me and told me the same story that you told me, which is, yeah, but the problem is, no one owns the story, right? I've tried Jonathan, I've tried to do it over here, and I've tried to do it over here, and I've tried to negotiate with and it doesn't happen.

Now, nav, my bet. I said this to NAV the other day. NAV, I'm going to make a bet. I'm going to make a bet that you're my guy, right? You're the guy.

But that's our vision, and that's first priority some so that I have to change my roadmap, but I can show you what I'm doing right with my roadmap. It has to come together, right? Whatever resources I have, a certain amount of reasons available, I need to really spend it on it, and Errol has to be also honest, because Errol has like, 5000 problem. He's like, behind on everything and not enough resources. He may say, Yeah, this is a great, great thing. Jonathan, I don't know what he needs to do for you. Maybe it's he says, I already have built everything. You know, great. Is it really true? I don't know, but I know that. I say it's a good story, but I need to make this a priority.

Yeah, because they don't want the Toyota case, or they don't want to suitcase, or, you know, somebody who disrupts it totally and takes over a quarter of your of your resources and your roadmap. They basically said, No, you're too early. We're still building this right, and that they believe in their vision, they believe in the story, they believe where they want to go. And then it's easy, because then the prioritisation is done at the top and you don't have to sweat it in the bottom. We just execute according to the one plan. Like you said, the roadmap plan, everyone you know came together building right? So it's up to leadership. Basically, if what is there more? What's more important?

    "content": "this quote vibe, quoting, quote pad piece. And Tina's talked to you about this. The concept is today's CPQ is an order entry product, like the foundations, the DNA of this thing was, I'm selling billing, and our customers are asking for sales reps to create an order in Salesforce that was picked up. And then they built more rules, and then they built a designer, a quote designers, you could really make that order form look better. That was the fruition of CPQ. So what happens in the sales world's real world? They are like experimenting with pricing and packaging, most likely in Excel or Google Sheets. Then they go figure out what the right discount is based on a couple of options. Then they'll put that into a pretty slide deck, and then they'll throw it over the fence and say, Hey, like, this is your this is your offer. And you can, like, call your favourite sales buddy to say, hey, like, can you send me some of this stuff? Like, walk me through how you sell deals. So once the deal is like, some verbal like, hey, sales rep here on the right target, then these guys come in to CPQ, and then they start, like, manually creating their orders. So it's really like the draft workflow is way out of Zora. Then they focus on, like, doing the heavy lift in Zora. Some of our customers hate CPQ so much. The reps like, don't do it at all. It's literally like they throw that PDF over the fence to a deal desk person. Deal desk person is literally creating the quote. So you're going to see that added dimension. That's because Cbq is painful. A bunch of drop down lists of a bunch of products you don't really understand. There's no context of you. There's no context of your customer. If you're up selling. There's no life cycle built into this thing. Like, we're a recurring billing product. Like, we know when you're when you're recurring. Deal is about to end. Why aren't we smart enough at like, three months before the end go route back and create a draft quote in Jonathan's inbox and say, Hey, like, just heads up. Zoom is about to renew in three months. You should probably start fucking putting this thing together and talking to zoom and figuring this out. Like, we don't close the loop there. There's a lot of issues from a subscription billing perspective. And there's a lot of issues from, like, a more complex world of like, I'm selling hardware and software or selling, like IOT devices. There's no, like, complex configurator where you can just say I wanted this, and then this opens up a new list of questions and another list of questions. There's a lot of gaps in the core CPQ product, and then there's this new world that we've never even touched. So the agreement is, and I've told this to Manfred as of last week, and I'll give you an understanding of why in just a second, but the agreement that it landed with Manfred is like, I need you on the CPQ problem. I need a fresh coat of paint on this thing. I need the approval, advanced approvals. I need the configurator. I just need you to really clean up this thing, because this is the thing that's selling right now, and I need to make more money on this thing. And then Siva and Satish, I'm gonna let them go run off and go work with teen to go figure out what this shift left world is, where you get to simulate and pretend like you're creating quotes. All right, so that's what I've told Manfred. I hope I hope that's like resonating with him. I need to check back in with him. It might be I know satisha was going to go talk to him. And then I also want you the opportunity to go Understand, understand what these two worlds are. Hey, there's this vibe quoting thing that I know teen is all up working on, and I know Shakir has asked you to work on, like the cpqx thing. And can you walk me through these two worlds? Yeah, Okay, gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 2  6:09 I spent, I spent quite a lot of time, so I've had some conversations with man food already. I also spent a lot of time with Satish, getting his lens of that of what you gave me a bit more depth and history to it. So this super valuable, the bit that I couldn't join up was the compliance piece on the vibe quoting bit, yeah, like it seems to be a it, I think, I think Satish, I don't know, I haven't spoken to Siva, but Satish felt, when I kind of prodded him on this, that it was a gap, but it was, it was a gap that no one really wanted to think about right now, like we\n\nSpeaker 1  6:54 don't want so we don't want any imagine A world where you get to experiment and go rogue.

Like, I found this to be a problem. This product doesn't work with this product. And like,\n\nSpeaker 2  7:30 that feels like the join. It's like, the bit I had a problem with was the publish right? If you publish, push the CPQ, the computer says, No, you have to go back in. Then the product doesn't work right. The last mile is not there. If you're validating in flight, then it does. So that's the bit I was talking to. That was the bit I was talking to Satish about. It feels like validation needs to have some concept within this vibe quoting, because it's the last mile that creates a frustration for the for the you know, it's like, I'm going to build this thing, push it 10 times. It says no, I'm going to stop pressing publish. I'm going to go back to my Excel spreadsheet. Because it doesn't so I think that's, yeah, okay, that's good, makes sense to me. But so is, is vibe quoting out of my purview. Then I stay out of that. Do I?\n\nSpeaker 1  8:20 Here's, I don't know how to frame this the right way. Okay. Teen is he thinks that Manfred just can't get out of his own CPQ way. He's been very clear to get Manfred out of the way, like, please, I need to work with 123, a small team. He's specifically said verbatim, I think Jonathan gets it. I know Siva gets it, and I know Satish gets it, but I just cannot have Manfred\n\nSpeaker 2  8:53 in the room. That's fine. So I can play in the same sandbox as Siva and Satish 100% okay, that's good, yeah, because, yeah, that's fine. And I also think that there's a way to, you know, what you don't want is ultimately you have to join the two things together, which means you have to join the human beings together, which means Manfred has to be brought along at some point on that journey, so that it's the same thing. Otherwise, you inherently build friction into the product team, and that's not okay. So that get that completely, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  9:27 I, I mean one thing, I actually love Manfred. I really respect him as a product owner. I I feel like in some cases, he's just very binary and very German, and teen is not,\n\nSpeaker 2  9:44 yeah, I guess I like Manfred, though he's a collaborator. You know, he loves to share, thinking he wants to teach and listen. You know, he's a great product manager because he's good in front of the customers. I think so. From what I've seen. He asked the right questions. He's not confrontational, you know, he's thoughtful. So I like him as a person, so I can understand where that join is. And we've had a couple of good conversations. And one of the things I pitched to him, and again, it's, how do you as a product leader? How do you receive this stuff? Do you just kind of stare and say, Okay, this guy doesn't know what he's talking about, or let me listen and see if I can shape a story. And I asked him the question around behavioural data.

I haven't had time to dig into it with him, but, but what we're doing with Anirudh on the data acquisition side and this knowledge graph, it feels like there's a potential join there at some point, someone to validate. I'll validate that out with him. It won't mean, I mean, I'll tell you what I'm going to pitch on it next week, but it won't mean changing the CPQ road map. It's just trying to find out, are there any adjacencies across the entire product that add value? If they don't, we won't do them if they do, and we can test them out internally and then externally. Then then that becomes potentially a join\n\nSpeaker 1  11:20 Yeah, I love that. Look my I think we're just I don't understand how dumb we are around CPQ. We don't capture the quote information, like pre quote. We don't capture the sales rep information. We were so hyper focused on the order, and that means I can't do simple things like, Hey, who's my badass sales rep? Hey, can you build me the sales org chart in Zora so I can actually see this stuff? Can you help me build an approval engine? Because now I have the sales org Now I know that Jonathan works for this person who works for this person. There's, can you build me a leaderboard that shows me not only who's the number one sales rep, but actually walked me through who takes the longest, who, who gives the most discounts, all those analytics and metrics, we've literally said we don't care. We don't want to be in that business. Historically, at this company, it's weird to me.\n\nSpeaker 2  12:16 Well, I think, I think all of the upstream data is excluded, like everything, everything about the customer is excluded. The work that we're doing with Anirudh and Shabazz on this churn agent is a major, major unlock, because what we've managed to do is to understand how someone gets to a churn that, to understand that and then to then feed that into what would be the down sell or cross sell to that customer. It's the same principles and CPQ, but that's something that I want. I've asked Andy Rud and maybe Shabazz to present that to you and Pete next week. I did want to try and find half an hour in your diary on Monday, because I've talked about churn and arc and all this kind of stuff. But you should see it anyway. So I agree with you. I think I think it's right. I think that the go fix the thing that's being sold, and then let us do this thing over here. But what I want to try and do is say, listen, we're going to do this thing over here, and then we're going to, we're going to bring this all back together in a holistic view, so that there's that power, you know, there's that, there's that end product vision. So that's great, and I love working with Satish. I haven't met Siva, but, but I love, you know, I kind of enjoy him. Yeah, good. Thank you for that. That's good\n\nSpeaker 1  13:27 background. Okay, so just for Manfred, just keep a lookout, keep him focused. I want to, I want a badass CPQ X roadmap from him. I don't, yeah, I want visibility into it, and then I want him to get super scrappy, like put on a fresh coat of paint. I just need some CSS. I need it to look more modern. I don't need big ass features. I just need small, scrappy, quick wins. But if he is going to build a big Harris featured, then it's probably approvals. That's the big one. That's the noisy one. Okay, so Errol. The big thing for Errol this week and last week is plasmic experiences. So the first thing that I'm personally taking on is getting his SKU created.\n\nUnknown Speaker  14:19\n\nI've told Errol and\n\nSpeaker 1  14:24 Jimmy that I'm what they tend to do is they go they go so broad and they're not prescriptive, it's really frustrating.

So I'm, I'm I've overtaken, and that may frustrate him and annoy him, I apologise, but if I do the he wants a free tier, but when I dig in, there is no ability. First of all, we're not contracting a free tier with plasmic. So how am I going to lose money? I can't give it for free to everybody right now. Then there's this middle tier, and then there's an advanced tier, and the advanced tier doesn't exist. So what he doesn't understand is for rev, rec policy.

I need to turn this on today, and otherwise we'll have rev rec challenges, and we've got to do all this other exception reporting and shit like that. So I will get this view done.

I don't know if it's a if it's a GS thing from Jimmy, whether it's just a general thing from Errol that he just generally doesn't think people understand, but I've been in the meeting since the beginning, yeah, and I've seen I had the same approach as Satish, which is okay, if we're going to do This, we got one shot to do it. Let's let's understand everything, and let's make the right decisions, architectural, the right architectural decision, but also the right product decisions. And it's been extremely difficult to do that. Extremely difficult because it really is a blank. I want to talk specifically about Jimmy, so I don't think Satish is being a blocker. I think he's asking the right questions. I've been in the calls, and generally the response is, listen, just trust us. It works like that's okay, but, but can we maybe just get some of the detail? Let's dig into this. And we've had multiple meetings, and the other thing that that Errol tends to do is he will say, Listen, I've written a 400 page document. Go, you know, and I've got 900 JIRAs, right? Go and read them. And I'm trying to say to Errol, people don't have the time to do that. They don't. They need to internalise what it is your vision is. And when they internalise it, they need to try and connect the dots to other things, like Alan, for example, back into the journey orchestration with Zephyr. You know, what does my account mean? Have we captured both the my account for the media customers, which of which? We have many using my account? Have we captured everything for Subscriber Portal? Do we have a single product? That was the message",

    "content": "you gave? I want a single product. I want to deprecate the old thing. I don't want two experienced builders. I want one thing, and it's generally quite hard to get that information. And in addition to that, there's a lot of misinformation. So for example, the the Toyota deal, which I did a lot of digging into, was used as a lever. I'm not dumping a whole bunch of shit on you. I'm just trying to give you the background. Was used as a lever for my account. And of course, the Toyota deal has got nothing to do with my account. It's got to do with a payment form, right? So the the two things that come it doesn't, doesn't change the direction of travel, but that it's this kind of minimal amount of information transfer which then creates a lack of trust, requires due diligence and then clarification, and then we come back together. So on, on, plasmic, I would Toyota that Toyota is clearly something that came up that had not come up before, right? We've been talking about it hadn't come up. What had come up is we have to get my account built by November. And I said, Listen, this was before I was running this team. I said, I don't think that's realistic. We need to capture everything and make sure that plasmic is the right thing for every scenario, because they completely ignored the c2 experience in Zephyr. It was for them. It was nothing. They didn't want to consider it. So we managed to get everyone together, and we've aligned on what that looks like, and we have Alan doing it. But then the next thing was, we have to get my account up by this by December, using Toyota as the example. And so there's so I would argue that there is a it is the it is the lack of velocity is due to just some lack of trust and clarity. I mean, Satish is just honestly going I just want to make sure that the architecture is right, and I need all this information in order to make that decision. Maybe that could be accelerated by a week or two weeks, but we're not talking about major changes. Now that we understand what Toyota is, we're clear, in order to win a $300,000 deal, we need to do the Toyota thing. But the Toyota thing is not my account. My account is a much bigger thing. The Toyota thing is a very narrow requirement. All right, we're building for a customer again, but we all know we can get that done. The other thing is, sorry, this is a monologue. We've got this anyway. Let me pause there, so you and I have the same experience. Everyone has the same experience with Errol and Jimmy. Let me just talk about Errol. Errol, I'm trying to, you know, synthesise all of his documentation down to simpler language, right? You know, so polymorphic and canonical and things that just shut people down. I'm trying to level that out, translate his documentation and be the filter for him, right? Whilst not, I can't constrain Errol. Errol is a great product manager, product leader. You know, 30 years in the business as he as he likes to remind everybody. So you have to let Errol do his thing, otherwise, Errol will walk but at the same time, and I'll talk about my strategy for next week, you have to create some framework, right? So that's that. So we will get there. But I wouldn't point at Satish, genuinely my experience, and say, Hey, you're just holding things up. He's asking the right questions, but we will get the Toyota thing done.\n\nUnknown Speaker  23:04\n\nMy concern is not\n\nSpeaker 1  23:07 t Well, my concern is to teach his bandwidth right like he's spread very thin. He's now the product manager of this vibe quoting thing, and needs to meet with teen hours per day, hours per day, because team won't let go. Okay? So now Satish, who has always been hyper, CPQ focused one foot out the door on catalogue and zero feet in the door for experiences, is now having another initiative on his plate and having to scale so his second tier is weak. Viva is not technical. She's programme manager on the catalogue side. Alan Alan Chu, not not your Allen. Allen Chu is very junior engineer. He's not strategic when it comes to CPQ, and then your Allen is the sentiment. I don't know Alan at all. The sentiment is he's very architecty. He's not a hands on keyboard developer, so he's not like a tailor. And the fact is that the other two people are quite Junior and need coaching by somebody who's like hands on keyboard, that's why, and Taylor couldn't do that. That's why Taylor was moved out of being a manager, because he wasn't a coach. He was a mentor. He's an awesome developer, but he's kind of just a rogue engine, so like putting Alan into the mix means you have a good architect, but the team is still struggling to have a mentor who can show them how to code. That is That is why Errol is frustrated. That is why Jimmy is frustrated and and Moo and Satish aren't really hearing the feedback of like, hey, just throw in another dev that actually knows how to code into the scrum team to help translate Alan's architecture to like what we can actually build. Okay? So that\n\nSpeaker 2  25:11 all right. So if it's a reason, if it's a resource issue, that's fine. I think it tends to be a finger pointing exercise, but I will speak to Satish. I move the point is, is that there has to be a solid motivation for it. So I think what happens is the approach sometimes falls flat. There's a bit of friction between Satish and Errol, and so I will, I'll speak to both Satish and Errol about that Jimmy. Jimmy's a different kettle of fish, but I don't know how Jimmy got to where he is, but he's a product manager that no one wants to deal with. Well, no one wants to deal with him. I mean, we've got this we've got this news court pitch tonight at 10 o'clock UK time to, I think two o'clock your time. And the lack of collaboration and resistance to engaging is, is in, you know, I've not seen it before. The other thing is, is that in the discovery phases of experiences, is extremely combative, right? Doesn't want to share information. It's kind of, I told you, it works. Why don't you",

I've got another meeting with him this afternoon or this evening my time. I want to try and find out a pattern that I can get to with him.

Errol doesn't see and that's, that's probably the biggest challenge.\n\nSpeaker 2  27:11 Yeah, I agree with you. I agree with you.

Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2  28:09 okay, let me, let me just see how he does this evening with News Corp. Let me get the feedback from the Australia team as well. Okay, and then I'll feed I'll speak to Jim, and I'll feedback to you. I'll let you know. I'll handle it, but I'll that's good context besides CPQ, so on catalogue, is there anything around that strategically that you in the same way that you described? CPQ, how do you frame catalogue? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  28:42 So, okay, what you have a high potential, up and coming product owner there. Her name is rolly. Rolly, sitting in Canada. Rolly will be at the leadership off site as a special invited guest. So I want you to spend some time with her. She came from Amdocs. She knows billing really well, so she's doing what you're doing. She's an Erol translator. Errol has no understanding of billing. He's a commerce guy who's faking it till he makes it. And Rolly does a really good job of balancing what Errol wants from a commerce perspective, into what a billing customer needs in terms of, in terms of what's next. There is hard bundles, which Satish stepped in and solutioned, okay, so there's like, hard bundles, and then there's dynamic bundles, and then in the middle, Satish inserted himself because he was in the middle of a black line escalation on the ability to take a hard bundle but add something to it, which is almost a Step into dynamic bundles. It's a it's a weird concession. At any rate, what they'll do is they'll put a little flag around this ad with a hard bundle flow, so that the blast radius is quite small to just to Hey here black line. Take this thing and fucking get off my back. But the designs, Manfred and Errol have done a good job of partnering well, and Satish is going to done a great job of like bridging them, and Rolly is executing so as the Big Top of Mind feature, the next real big thing, which has been on our requirements or ask AOCs for 10 years, is bundles. So that team just needs to keep their head down. They clocked a real big win now that they're GA they need to now focus on getting bundles out the door, hard bundles, and then soft bundles or dynamic bundles next as a quick follow, and then it's a and then, honestly, at that point in time, if we don't deliver anything else, if Errol's like, I'm done, I'm out of here, then I'm not concerned, because those that's the only thing that we've been playing catch up on. Everything else is now about helping our customers move to the new catalogue, because I k",

So what's your thinking just generally on the risk of Errol and his importance generally in the org?\n\nSpeaker 1  32:58 I would, I would probably push on rolly to step up. Yeah, it's my humble opinion. Agreed. I think the team is four or five engineers. The team is four or five engineers who are focused on the catalogue. So it's kind of a small team. Anyways, make really step up. Yeah, and is sure is the other person on Errol's team. He's kind of weak. He's as well. Errol's been micromanaging him to try and get him to drive. He owns custom objects, custom rules.\n\nSpeaker 1  33:38 So you look, if that whole org fizzled, and we need to start from scratch. The only person I would really want to save is is rolly.\n\nSpeaker 2  33:48 Okay, let me spend some time with her then, okay, I spent, I spent, I do need more time with you in Redwood City for some other questions, but I spent a lot of time with NAV. I like nav. He knows where the bodies are buried. And I've, I think he's a, I feel like he's a good partner, right? So I'm trying to understand how he sees the organisation and what he, you know, he's, he was in, he built BCS with, actually, the Zephyr team. Zems was built by tyre on the Zephyr team with Chiron.\n\nUnknown Speaker  34:29 I don't, I don't, I don't\n\nSpeaker 2  34:32 believe there's a necessity for BCS and zems to live in the in the catalogue team. They feel like services that should have some focus. I think they're important things. But I spoke with NAV, and my pitch to him was, which is very kind of what I'm thinking generally, is that you can't it in the short term. You can't brute force a product leader with many years of experience into a different product roadmap, right? We're at, you know, we've got a week till we have to deliver PRDs. As you said, you've got a stack rank, which is Manfred. Go off and build, you know, improve the cpqx. Give it a lick of paint. Sorry, next gen CPQ give it a lick of paint. Give me a bunch of stuff that's missing, that's really constrained and focused on Errol side. It's like, give me bundles. Maybe there's a fast follow on other stuff. So you kind of, I feel like you kind of leave those guys to do what they what they need to, and then there's some finessing around all of that, right? But it's, it's a, it's, it's, you don't want to just come in and and wedge into those strategies, because it'll blow up, right? But my feeling is, is that at the intersection of Zora acquisition, Zephyr discovery, whatever we're going to call it experiences, CPQ and catalogue, there are connect, there are intersections, right? They cross over. And it's at those intersections that I think the platform story is right. You can let the capabilities be built by the product teams. You have to enable the product leaders to build what they want, right? That those have that what they're selling has to be bought by you, and they have to deliver based on their commitments in the JIRA, right? So that's that's kind of baked in, and that's the capabilities, but the intersection is where these services connect. And I, you know, at the risk of being a bit reductive, I kind of see it like it's like a burger at the top. You've got the story. So I'm doing a lot of work with Mark gagne, Paulo, Steve Boone Emmy, to try and understand underneath silver lakes, B to B complex SARS focus, and then through the filter of your 12 bets and then, and then down to what the field is. Is wanting, you know, because Emir is different to APAC, which is different to no am is, what is the tote? What is the story? And it's that thing I pitched to you is, can we be vendor for life? Can we go from 50 mil to a billion, you know? And I'm just validating that out. I'm again, I'm agnostic about at the moment, because I haven't had generally buyers, but I need to refine it underneath. It feels like the intersection of these capabilities is where the engineering architecture story is, right? So what is the platform? And it seems to be that that is the place that it breaks down, right? Because we call the what CPQ needs from catalogue. We call it a dependency, and then the dependency is exactly that, right? It's like, Oh, I've got another dependency from catalogue, from CPQ. It's not necessarily what I want to build. Or experiences has a has a thing, and then Zephyr has a dependency on experiences. And so my focus was going to be at the intersection, and I wanted to work with NAV to say, what is the platform and where are the intersections weak? And how do we create the narrative at the top? And whether we have, you know, lettuce or turkey or hamburger or whatever in the middle, which is the product, I can take out pieces and put in pieces, as long as they support the story at the top, and they're supported by the architecture.

Now, framing of BCS is almost Okay. Me. I was supposed to talk to him today, and yesterday, he has been busy, but I'll try to find time with him. In any case, Errol has scheduled something for later today for me and him to talk with Tony. So but that discussion I'm going to be pretty much silent on knowingly, because I want to see what Errol and Tony discuss. At some stage, this document will be with Tony. I think whatever he's doing, we can pick bits and pieces of that and then get out. The problem with Tony is he's not very good at collaboration. He's not so you got to rein him in and tell him to stop sometimes and say, No, do this much. He can be super fast. The outcome is either going to be extremely useful or outcome is going to be extremely not useful. Still, well done, elegantly, architecturally, like technical architecture wise, he does good job. Yeah, but is it aligned to you or not? Is a question. So sometimes the PMs that he has worked with, they'll say, Just take what he gives you, and then, you know, slowly, slowly, slowly, morph it. Now he works well when he has one point of channel of inputs coming to him. That's how Tanmoy used to do with him. You guys give me the input. I'll tell Tony what to do. Now he's getting multiple channels, so he's trying to consolidate everything and then come up with something, which is the document he did is not very far from what I was actually white boarding with him, but the fact that he has added bunch of stuff has confused everyone, like that seemed like way too much complicated than we needed right now. So tomorrow or Monday, I'm hoping that I'll give him this document, whatever I have done, and then have a rational chat with him that, look, there is a reason. There's a method to the madness. Whatever you have done. Let's take bits and pieces and organise into this. So to give you a rundown of this, the way I'm thinking is there's one decision engine within that, there's an orchestration of decision and there are domain specific engines at the back. The reason I'm saying that we have to have domain specific engines is because your precision, your control, your governance, your tuning, cannot happen in one size fits all. It cannot happen in one place. So that's why domain engines are very much important. Domain engines will come together to form a plan. There has to be a plan compilation. Now, what Tony has done, technically speaking, the tech we may be able to use, and then we say, Yep, great. It still works within 50 milliseconds. The tech is reusable. Let's take the bits and pieces and run with that. We may have to reorganise some pieces so it's, it's okay. I guess there is, there is no, could he have done something else? I do not know. Did we lose the time that he spent on this? I don't think so entirely. No, he was, I think he's fast.\n\nSpeaker 1  6:57 I mean, he delivered something fast, at least. You know, what is his frame of references? At least, at least we have a point of view that that was the main goal for me is that, you know, I'm not opposed to someone like Tony having a positioning statement, as long as when the feedback comes in, it quickly narrows down to some important changes. And I think Manfred has done that. I've tried to do that from a much higher lens. Errol's done that. You're going to do that. I think what that does is, at least it's a it's to be honest, it's a much faster start than I thought we were going to have. And I've got to a poin",

Yeah, we own the idea of this middle layer, this intersection only came into being three weeks ago. Yeah? So here we are. We've got an architectural, you know, statement from you, and we've now got a body of work from Tony. Yeah, I think that's extremely good progress.\n\nSpeaker 2  8:42 Yeah, we can. We can really quickly circle on this. I think if I wanted to talk to him today, if he's available after your call, I'll probably ask him if you are available for 30 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1  8:54 Let's have a chat. So what your your starting point with Errol is going to be, are you sharing? Are you going to walk him through the document? You're going to share it and open it up for commentary.\n\nSpeaker 2  9:09 I haven't completed it just yet, so you would see towards the end the experience pieces just to open, yeah, but those are not heavy pieces. I'm just going to document some high level thoughts on that, and then I will open it up for ever",

I expect that more or less people are going to be like, Yeah, okay, but if there is something, then we can refine through that\n\nSpeaker 1  9:30 as well, on, on the while you were writing it, when you think about the effort needed to deliver this.\n\nUnknown Speaker  9:43 What I'm interested in is\n\nSpeaker 1  9:46 does, what portion of this does falls to the individual road maps, and what portion falls to an abstraction of a group of people to build this layer or to build the architecture. I guess the one of the questions that's being asked by Silver Lake is to justify the commitments that we make against potential. ARR and so in to be open with you, if the if the teams remained as they were, and we were able to deliver this by, I think we, you and I talked about the idea of squads, so the teams remain where they are, but, but you have squads focused on that, has this changed in any way? Or are you still?\n\nSpeaker 2  10:41 No, I don't think so that changes. I don't think so that changes. However, the decisions have to be, what do we do first? I'm just going to pull up some one of these architectural flows that I created that are reasonably high level, but at seven time gives us everything. Okay, let's work through this. Maybe not commerce, domain service. Commerce Domain Services. I need a detailed one decision engine. Forget about this experience. Okay, let's start with this. This probably helps. So if I go by the domains, my thinking is this is back end for the front end experience gateway. Right on top of it, you have experience element for CPQ, for partner portal, for self service, all of these things in there we need to figure out what is the common set as well, and who does what? So that is one squad, experience front end, and they own the experience gateway as well. Yeah, right. The experience gateway is everything comes to a same grammar and goes through this guy. Cool. That is good. Now this context layer is piece number two. Squad numb",

So now if I go down below or No, actually, not down below here, so\n\nUnknown Speaker  12:20 channels in Persona. Forget about it.\n\nSpeaker 2  12:24 I'm actually drawing up something for the context. Let me see if I can pull that up right now.\n\nUnknown Speaker  12:32 Can you Google? Allow me?\n\nSpeaker 2  12:42 We should be able to allow screen switching as well. But anyway, so this is what I'm really working on just now, to make sure that I can understand what the context is going to be. So I'm blowing up the contact service now, like in my head, at least that what work do we need to do in the context service front ends are okay? We got to feed Zoda services. We got to feed external sources as well. You got ingestion. You got schema, which is your control plane. Then you got your runtime as well. Now this is your context. That means this is a body of work by itself that needs to be in a squad. This diagram is not there. I'm just completing it now. I'll dump it back in the document as well, shortly. Okay, so this is literally what I told you is back then is literally what I'm trying to think of as well that, hey, what are the scores are going to work on it? So we got one squad working on this, one squad working on so one on the experience and experience gateway. Second here, then comes decision orchestration. Decision orchestration is a huge piece by itself. I believe why? Because I'm saying you are configuring your decisions here. These are your domain engines. Okay, I might abstract the UI of that, but these are my domain engines, where I'm configuring my decisions for pricing, promotion, packaging and time, whatever tomorrow. This allows me that if I have a new type of this domain, I can just do something here as well as an engine. Then there is a compiler, which is my which is which is sitting up on the top of all of this, and that basically gets stored here, policy and plan store. When the request comes, the router says in the execution engine, I just execute it. Great. So these individual pieces do not need to be same team. We can find how we bring these together and which team can take more than one. For example, approval is going to go to workflow team. I don't care, right? I may need to influence them, but Sure, but promotion pricing maybe can sit together. Maybe promotion pricing and packaging can sit together. These three, recommendation can go to a data science team that I'll feed you your data. You do the recommendation engine, but somewhere, architecturally speaking, they should know how they are built, so that they can start the work. We need to get to the point where we say we know enough about the second or third level of the detail of these domain engines that I can start working parallel recommendation team. You have this pipeline that will be delivered to you. You can build on that you can you can fine tune the feature set that you're going to look at and then the recommendation, but first, there is a work for deterministic engines as well, and that deterministic engine set can probably sit with one team, this decision orchestration, I would say, should also sit with that team, because it'll be faster. They will know that what I'm going to expect from domain engine and how I'm going to execute. So like, literally quite I see at least three, but maybe four to five scores working on these things. And now comes your experience. Probably some back end, dedicated pieces that are going to be CPQ has CPQ catalogue and has CPQ catalogue and has catalogue. So, yeah, going to back back to my point, five or six quads you will have in there, it seems,\n\nUnknown Speaker  16:13\n\nyeah. So\n\nSpeaker 1  16:16 assuming that we, we could arrange that team structure, how? Two questions, how far does this get us towards the vision of omni channel that we originally proposed back in Redwood City,\n\nSpeaker 2  16:35 against us? Right there. It gets us there. Okay, so it's exactly there. Okay. Now it may be that when we talk to squads, and squad doesn't have to be, you know, three people per team. No, the squad could be that, for example, domain engine has three squads, one dealing with packaging, other, dealing with pricing and promotion, one dealing with policy. They're all under Tony, yeah. Okay, great, right? Experience, CPQ, experience. This is going to hurt CPQ team, but CPQ experience and commerce experience, let's bring them together and do the experience gateway as well architecturally, write one squad. Now what happens CPQ team is building their own experiences right now. You are able to leverage some synergies in there and say, No, I'm going to bring it together, and this is what happens. You guys have to deliver common elements as well. So the vision starts becoming a reality if we could force that. But if you can't, then they will just go on their own path, and then we'll have to force them to come together after the fact, doing it right sometimes also means taking a step back or slowing down to pace up. People may not be ready to accept that, but that's something that you got to force. I think Manfred is very much ready. Errol may have some reaction to that. You are slowing my experiences down, but I think, like, yeah, these two squads, and then you leave a catalogue squad, which is, hey, you got to deliver versioning. Let's say versioning is done, but I'm giving an example,\n\nSpeaker 1  18:05 but there are two functions here. Behind this. Number one is Pete's commitment to delivering value, right? This is a pure value play. How do we take all of the assets that we have,",

The second is that silver lakes lens is return on investment, right? If I invest this amount of engineering resource, do I get the maximum amount? It's a classic PE play. This year is going to be the year of pre sell, of to work day. You know, we're positioning ourselves up. This is year two of the three year plan. So if we're going to spend the dollar, you know, what's the ROI on that dollar and prove the ROI on that dollar. So this is a very thoughtful use of resource, because what we're saying is, you know, measure twice, cut once, deliver the maximum amount of value that you can for the effort that you're investing so and also to not leave any parts of the acquisition to order or behind. You know, not building for one piece and not the other and the other. So I agree. We're completely alive. So as I would expect, you've delivered what you said you were going to deliver. What are what? I think there are two things that need to happen now. Number one, I need to read it in detail and read it alongside Tony's doc. But then I think what I need in the in the beginning of the year next year, is an opinion from you and probably Tony, well, let's say from you about what your your assessment of Errol manfred's Manfred is quite What I've learned recently is Manfred is quite trusting of engineering, right? So he will say, Well, if the engineering team say they can deliver it and that's what I want, then I'm going to trust that decision. That's perfectly fine. Errol's more in the weeds around the the engineering decisions, but I guess the final assessment is going to come from you, where you go. Listen, I have consensus or not. First of all, I accept what Tony's bill as being a valid part of this, this view, and then I have consensus that this view that I'm presenting, which absorbs Tony's implementation of a portion of it, is the thing that gets us to omni channel, right? So if that consensus is then true, we will use that document and synthesise that for different stakeholders. And you know, some of it will be to the field, which will be very reductive and shiny. Some will be to Pete, which will be much more kind of robust and formulated, and then we will have to have a bit in the middle, which is, how do we prove to Silver Lake and to Shakir that the way in which we want to structure the engineering org in service of this is has got some value. And I think that omni channel. I mean, Omni channel is now very heavily baked into sko so the business seems to have completely accepted that we are acquisition to cash. We're still some distance from being able to actually do that, but the document that you've created is that. So, yeah, that's amazing. Let me. Let me. Then go away, read it, and then I'll\n\nSpeaker 2  21:45 this is why I'm going to write one more section towards the end, which is experience I'm going to actually say this, which is, I wrote it, I removed it, because I was like, I'm going to share with you Manfred and Errol. And I was expecting Errol to not be happy with that, because that section, especially because he's very sensitive about experience. And my view of experience is, I'm not trying to break what you're doing. I'm saying, I want you to sit with man, Fred and John, and say, we're going to do this. Is it something that you would want to influence. Hence, by the outcome, because of your influence, I'm giving you, I'm giving you a leverage. I want a return on investment for the leverage, which is he will use the elements I do, and he will say that team did something that accelerated my piece, which means we need to bring CPQ engineering on this. I spoke to Shiva. He's away all the rest of the year. But I'm going to give this document to Tony and Shiva as well after I write experiences. So expect some back and forth where you are trying to enforce some neuro elasticity, where the plastic city has settled in. That will be some work over there. You are right. Manfred is always in for such things. And I'm not saying it's 100% reuse, but I'm saying, Have you done the work to say, look, I'm not going to be able to reuse anything, listen, or I cannot build it any way, the way you are expecting it to be.\n\nSpeaker 1  23:13 You've created a point of view here, right? Yeah, and it's a point of view that's tangible and it has a very precise outcome at the end of it, which is true, Omni channel. So there are a number of things about that. The most important is, when we present it back to the business, the business has to make a decision. Do they want omni channel?\n\nUnknown Speaker  23:39 Right? And if they want omni channel,\n\nSpeaker 2  23:42 good point, I see you're elevating that further.\n\nSpeaker 1  23:45 Yeah, we, we entered this, you know, now, Vero, myself, Manfred, we entered the room, and we said, in a very simplistic way, we have to build an intersection in order to get us to a true omni channel. That was phase one. Phase two is the brains in the business went and built a view of omni channel from an engineering and architectural point of view. That's number two. So we have a we have a positioning statement, we have the substance behind it before we raise a single ticket, the we",

    "content": "have to say, do you want omni channel, right? I know the marketing team want it, and I know the sales team want it, but Pete and Shakir, do you want omni channel, right? Because, you know, I heard another story today. So anirudd built this very interesting SKU compactor, right? So I've, I've tested this with customers. I went to The Economist the other day, and I'm trying to get them to migrate to the new catalogue. And they said, we've got 1000 SKUs. We don't even know what to do. So we ran this process. We took it down to eight products and 47 PRPs, right? So they're like, Okay, now we understand our business better. And then I go out and I say, Well, can we what's the pathway to get this to production? And then I realised that what happened was, is it never got past the demo stage. Which works? The back end works because the 10x team shifted their focus on revenue. The billing team don't want to touch it because they don't own it. The catalogue team Errol never, never agreed with it to begin with, right? Although it has very high value in a number of cases, right, even if you just as a\n\nSpeaker 2  25:47 as a tool, it's a, put a plug in there and say, tool that,\n\nSpeaker 1  25:51 yeah, it's a tool. It gives you a lens of something you didn't have a lens of before. And it, what it does is it creates a very useful argument for why or for how to think about the new catalogue, right? Yes, it's a very, very valuable tool, as you say. I mean, even if\n\nSpeaker 2  26:13 it is one time execution, show it to the customer. You're not gonna lose anything. You're not doing any tight access.\n\nSpeaker 1  26:18 And maybe there's something else. But the point I'm making is this was always going to be the so when I speak to Anirudh, who invested a lot of time and energy into this and now cannot get it to market, it's like and if you, if we don't persist and follow this through, it'll be one of those bodies that are buried across aura of things that were built but just never been. Think about the engineering hours. Think about the time investment that went into that. Think about the thought process, you know. Think about Anirudh, you know, mental process to kind of build.\n\nSpeaker 2  26:57 I was there. I was the one who told Anirudh, don't do it one off. Do it recurring basis as well. That whenever you're creating a plan, it pops in and says, Are you going to associated with this plan because they're similar, or something like that? Then people get recurring value. But he told me that arrow doesn't see value in that arrow doesn't so he\n\nUnknown Speaker  27:16 doesn't because he doesn't because what?\n\nSpeaker 1  27:21 What no one in the business today knows is, what conversation Do I have with a customer who has the legacy catalogue, and what AE is going to spend an ounce of time my talking about the new catalogue. There's no money against it. It's not even an upsell. So a see it. No one wants to talk. No one's talking about it. But it's the most important thing we have in the business today, and it's the foundation of omni channel, right?\n\nUnknown Speaker  28:02 So there's a lot of moving\n\nSpeaker 2  28:04 incentive is internal and not external, exactly. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  28:08 Anyway, so listen, that's all amazing. I had a I wonder if I could just shot left a little bit and talk about CPQ. So I had a long conversation and a very interesting demo from John Burns the other day. Super guy really enjoyed talking to him, you know, he's got a view of of, you know, he's got a view which I particularly like, whether it's a general, whether it's an accepted view, I don't know, but he has a view. So we spent a lot of time, and I said that I would then battle test this thinking with with you. So I'm going to take a first pass at it, and then I'll send you a summary, a written summary of what I'm thinking, unless you completely kill it now, but I was told the story of how we lost the magic quadrant positioning right, and how we how we failed to deliver the C against the CPQ, right. And the basically, what happened was we didn't have configuration in the way that CPQ should have, we didn't have the C, right? So when I then look at taking one thing like configurable bundles\n\nUnknown Speaker  29:33\n\nor improving guided selling,\n\nSpeaker 1  29:38 and there were some other things, what was represented to me was that we could bring the C back into CPQ, and if we were to do that, and there's a bit other there's a bit additional stuff to this story, so I'll finish, and then I'll throw it back to you, is if we brought The C back in, and we defined what that C was, what we have in catalogue, what that enables in CPQ. Could we be in Salesforce? A magic quadrant? Contender, again, that's number one. Number two is this? This? This idea of next generation and CPQ, right? My understanding of next generation, and I've heard this a few times, I'm not even talking about vibe quoting. I don't even think. I don't even I think it's going to wither, because I don't think Pete wants it to survive, and I think it's a vanity project. But if we, if we talk about next generation, next g",

There's quote pad, which is a great demo, but nowhere close to quote studio. And there's a trajectory, which is, we'll get quote pad to parity with quote studio, right? At some point, right?\n\nUnknown Speaker  31:28 Quote pad, the white coding thingy, or no\n\nSpeaker 1  31:31 quote pad, is the quote pad is the next generation version, which is, you know, much more kind of natural language interface, etc, etc, right? So the story goes like this. In my head, quote pad is compatible with quote studio in that you can take a quote and push it into quote studio, but you can't take a quote studio quote and push it into quote pad. So quote pad is almost what vibe quoting was meant to be, which is, let's make it easier, but built with compliance and, you know, baked in which was vibe quoting was missing. Quote pad is a more substantive approach to a better experience with quoting, right? If it ever got to parity with quote studio, because it's headless, it would be a real contender. But until it has parity with quote studio, it becomes, you know, it's not a contender. Okay?

We bring it we win back our position.\n\nUnknown Speaker  33:20\n\nWe also\n\nSpeaker 1  33:23 accelerate quote pad to or find at least a timeline to parity, so that we have both a Salesforce environment and a headless environment for quoting and in the interim, if the worst thing that happens is that you can start on quote pad and end in quote studio, because you can push what you have in quote pad to quote studio, that feels a way of telling the story in a joined up way. Now the bit I'm asking you, and I will write it up, because I made a bunch of notes, is John's concern is that we don't, and this is exactly to the intersection. Again, we don't have a unified way of thinking about building for next gen and and Salesforce. And the bit that I was trying to understand is, is it because of the managed packages in Salesforce? Does the sales force environment just create this kind of insulated engineering pattern that can never be, you know, you can't build a thing that then is used in both places. You have to build for both environments independently. And that's the bit I don't understand.\n\nUnknown Speaker  34:40 Okay, this is going back six months, so I\n\nSpeaker 2  34:47 part of this is accurate, but part of this is how you approach things. It's not really black and white that, hey, we're not going to be at parity. It's about the journey that we want to deliver to the users.\n\nUnknown Speaker  34:59 And there are some decisions we have taken\n\nSpeaker 2  35:03 whilst catalogue from backward compatibility was impressive story, it was very difficult. So building something backward compatible versus building bridges are two different architectural design patterns. So the choice was, we will build bridges will not build backward compatibility, because backward compatibility will host, hold you hostage to so many design choices that were made, and then you were like, I can't do this. Because whatever I think, I did my groundwork on that, when I came down with the came down with the came up with a document of the next session, CPT and all that. I'm more than happy for John, who has been in the ecosystem for way too long now on this to take a stab at a document, six pager, no more six pager, should say, very high level front end supports these functionalities, these capabilities today, and these flows, just names and back end supports these functionalities, these capabilities. This is a tech behind that, and this is where it lies. Six pagers done. The exercise we should do from there on is what would be the minimal possible next generation CPQ look like with those capabilities. Now you are not talking you are showing that this is how the parity, as you say, you know the direction of travel towards the parity is going to look like, and this is hypothetically my timeline, right in next generation CPQ. I did that exercise based on my understanding of this, and I did say that day one, the UI of next gen CPQ will be in Salesforce iframe, not native iframe, yeah, which means you as a user will not hav",

Our CPQ today doesn't have C. I want to give C first, so there's a natural cognitive transition as well that I'll complete the C here, I'll submit and then I go and pull it back here. I can work with it, correct, done Correct. Or for simplest of use cases where you're not doing ramps, not doing commitments, those kind of things, you can use a new UI and finish it up as well. Sure. You can save it here. You can retrieve it here. I personally believe there is not a lot of complicated functionality in code studio. There is not the reason it is complicated is because we have implemented in a way that it is native into Salesforce. If I abstract it out and I say, I'm not never going to code for metrics that commerce needs, I'm going to configure the metric metrics that my flow needs, and then I have elements in commerce experience that will fetch me those metrics and render it for me. My job is lesser. This is what I'm pushing the guys for. Because if I want to do a Subscriber Portal, okay, or if I want to do a customer portal for, let's say zoom, where zoom can log in and do all these things for a given subscriber or for myself, when I log in as zoom into Zora Subscriber Portal. I want to see what is it that I'm paying to Zora. Like for Zora, that is MRR monthly, or ACV or ARR for zoom, it is a spin. So we should be able to do those elements in a way that I can reuse those things. Why am I repeating? And that's the same thing that the code needs as well. The card experience is the same. The C experience is different. That's why we should just build the c part first and say the new, next duration. CPQ brings the C to your life and works for those customers that have simple flow off of that end to end. If you want complicated multi subscription coding, parent child relationship, we don't have that here just yet. We'll do it here. Okay, focused effort and a good enough insulation will give us some velocity as well. The problem is the focus lacks and the insulation is just not there. Yeah, well, is now he was calling me. He was like, there are so many operational issues. I'm having to focus on this and this vibe coding thing as well. Teens project is vibe coding. I can't leave that next in CPQ.

Could we get that back to the Magic Quadrant by building the sea, right? So that we've got the catalogue which enables the sea?

    "content": "ck on Magic Quadrant. That is our 26th strategy, right? In order for it to be that we need configure it configurability. And in order to get configurability, we're going to leverage the catalogue, and that's going to be our focus, right? Anything else, you know has to, has to stack rank against that. I know the story with the with billing parity. You know, there's a lot of operational friction. You know, it's a large engineering team constantly fixing stuff, right? So I haven't even got down to that level yet, but what I want to ask you is,\n\nUnknown Speaker  41:10 do you think we can there\n\nSpeaker 2  41:13 is some practicality to this that we need to think about. The thought process is right, the intent is right, but the practical, the practical approach behind this, Jonathan, is going to be very difficult to get there in time. I'll tell you why. And I'm making some assumptions. You tell me if the assumptions are right or not. Assumption one is, first of all, agreement. One is, C is important, and we got to put it out there. Sure. How is the question? I'm hoping you're not saying this is the assumption part, that you're not saying that we build it in the current stack. We build C outside, but we build it in a way that it works, like a bridge design,\n\nSpeaker 1  41:56 a universal a pattern that works for both next generation and the CPQ in Sales Force. Yeah, yes, that's exactly,\n\nSpeaker 2  42:05 that's exactly a bridge, bridge design pattern. I call it bridge because you cannot have it work equally well for both you will have it work amazingly well for one side and it works for the other side. That is why the bridge is important, right? Yeah, if it had to work equally well, then you're going to be forcing yourself native Salesforce code, which is not the right thing for us to do. So let's say we make it work\n\nUnknown Speaker  42:29 good, good check in that case,\n\nSpeaker 2  42:35 if we are leveraging the work that we're going to do on decision orchestrator, decision engine optimizer, whatever we are saying for configuration and enhancing the product catalogue, they cannot start for next three to four months, or three months at least. So what are we giving them right now? What can they do right now? Is another thing. So I'm what I'm saying is the blocks of delivery for next six months. We have to arrange it in a way. This is where I was saying that we need a longer meeting. These all questions should come in that meeting and be like, okay, good. I got the commerce foundation and commerce piece. Let's lay it up at the top layer. And now John, you come and you say, this is what we want. And you go and you say, like, Jonathan is saying, I want 2026, magic warrant for CPQ, Jonathan, give me what you want for that. Manfred goes then we say the interdependencies are going to become complicated, and we will then rationalise that actually for next three months, let's focus on this in CPQ, and that this may be building the interface which are super simple for super simple codes, the backbone and the spine has a chat interface. There some sort of compliance that I can abstract out of Salesforce, because here are the things I don't need code in Salesforce for enforcing compliance. I can make a call to my engine. So let's pull it out. Let's lay the foundation for the next generation of the CPQ whilst we're getting ready for C, and by May, we will have a C and this whole compliance piece out and done 100%\n\nSpeaker 1  44:06 and in fact, that's a very similar narrative to how John presented it in his mind. So he's completely aligned with that. My feeling was, is that we've got someone like John who is also not being leveraged in the right now, I don't know the history, right, so I've had a few meetings with the guy, but my gut tells me that if he if what he's telling me is true, he is unnecessarily isolated from the next generation. CPQ, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  44:42 Is he? He was, I know he was, but I think that was by design that Manfred was chosen to run it, and John was. I went to John, by the way, myself, to engage him.\n\nSpeaker 1  44:51 It's not, it's not his influence. It's his, just his understanding of it, right, right, and understanding of direction. So he as a voice in the room. The narrative that you just gave me requires us to have other voices in the room exactly the same motion that we're running now, which is have a very precise direction of travel, and then get stakeholders in a very managed way so that it doesn't become too many cooks to contribute to a very precise direction and North Star. And that's, I think, what you've just described, is we abstract the sea. The sea is built in a way that it has utility in both places, right? That's a great, great way to think about ROI. But the bit that the business can adjust itself to is we want to be back in the Magic Quadrant. And by the way, when we get back in the Magic Quadrant for CPQ core, the same configurability is available in next generation, whic",

So, some alternate universe. See, next generation should be, it should be a Magic Quadrant can take, in fact, it should kill the Magic Quadrant and create a whole bunch of new benchmarks and be way out on the, on the, on the edge of the top right hand part of that chart. So is, do you think that's again? I know sometimes I can be reductive about these objectives, but that, that I think, is I could get a lot of people behind that view. I think,\n\nSpeaker 2  46:51 from a vision point of view, it's part of least resistance to get people behind it, but the credibility is going to lie on the plan of execution and how well the team comes together and gets behind the common objectives as well, which is why, like, it's not just going to be Manfred and John and CPQ team. We got to make sure that the Foundation team is an unbiased team, because as a foundation, team is going to be biassed, and CPQ might starve for what they need, and the natural inclination is going to be, I got to do what I got to do to deliver. Yeah, we're not. We're not going to allow that. We're not going to Yeah, so I do agree that the vision is right, and if I may, what's going to get us on the magic quadrant is not just C, it's going to be C. And there is something called S, which is scenarios. We don't support scenarios today, and there are not many that support scenario today. And if you are short of reading documentation while you are off the grid, then I'll send you this as well. I've written so much documentation that I should have my library of Laura. Now I just sent you that. So I just sent you the scenario piece out of that CPQ, DSL scenario piece. But that whole document has bunch of stuff and some evolving thoughts as well. I haven't touched it in last one and a half months, really two months, but you can go through that. That's I think you've got to have, see, you got to have scenario basics in there. And you got to be able to say, hey, you can go back and forth. You can play with the scenarios. You can push a proposal. We got to change how CPQ thinks. Not just I\n\nSpeaker 1  48:30 agree with you. Listen, there's money, there's there's increased revenue against CPQ, but it's fairly basic in its assumptions, which is, we put a lick of paint on CPQ, we build some of the missing functionality and we charge more for it. No one has mentioned C, no one has mentioned Magic Quadrant to me at all. Not Shakir, not P, nobody\n\nSpeaker 2  48:54 that hasn't been zora's goal. If you ask team, a while ago, we brought it up, and team was like, CPQ is not our play. That's just a catalyst.\n\nSpeaker 1  49:04 Well, there's, there's an uplift in revenue against it. It's a core to omni channel, and it's a damn site more built out than vibe quoting. Vibe quoting,\n\nSpeaker 2  49:14 I think, I think people haven't sold it well to him, including myself. Well, it's like catalogue.\n\nSpeaker 1  49:20 You know, catalogue is probably one of the most important things Zora has today. It's the differentiator. It's the entry point for everything. So listen, I again, what it is is just about taking what we have and creating clarity, and then, as you say, working out what the practicality is of delivering that. I do want to get John into the into the room, just so that he has some voice. So what I'm going to do is I will, I'll write up what I understood from John, I'll include what I understand from you. I'll create a just a narrative, couple of pages, and then we can maybe bring that to the table at the beginning of next year as well. And you know, if Pete or Shakira or team decide to shoot it down, that's fine, but at least we'll know what's not on the table. That's what I also want to find out. What do I not have to think about? Cool? All right, listen, as always, really super, super helpful. And I genuinely appreciate the fact that you said you were going to do it, and you did it, almost, in fact, to the day you did it, to the day you said you were going to give it to me on Friday, last Friday you did, which I so appreciate.\n\nUnknown Speaker  50:39 There's some some open items, which I'll close.\n\nSpeaker 1  50:43 That's fine. It's, it's, it's, it's substantive. So, yeah, I feel good about I feel good about it. Okay, obviously what we've got to do is got to get we've got to get all these heads in a room. We got to whiteboard it out. But we what we do now have, which is very different to before, is we have something documented, we have clear positioning. We have some positions that people are going to negotiate around, and that's a good thing.\n\nSpeaker 2  51:12 And there is a bit of more work on this.

They're just worried about how to make it seem cool on the outside, yeah, or to Okay. And so, you know, I've spent five years building quote, Studio, you know, and took about a year and a half to get it from POC to, like, GA, ready, full, full time, right? Like, real. And I think that I struggled too, because I would have held back making quote studio GA for longer, and my leadership at the time is, like you, we just need to release it. We're going to learn on the fly. We're going to iterate quickly. And that was the right call at the time, right like, whereas I would have waited six months we put it out there, a couple customers got on it. They hammered us with like, issues and bugs and things, and we had to adapt quickly, and we did, and now we have 80 customers, 85 customers on it. But you know, I think that the other side of that coin can be very dangerous, where you go way too early, you put something out there that's just completely unusable, and you lose, you know, confidence from our customers on what we're doing, especially when things are business critical. And so where a lot of the company, I don't think, realises that CPQ is, some of the businesses that have purchased it and use it, is extremely critical. I mean, it's, it's like, do or die, where if you, if you using Zora and CPQ doesn't work, you can't use ora. So anyways, that's, that's my like sentiment right now. I'm, I'm eager to make it a reality. I'm eager to get into the weeds of it. But I haven't actually been bought into those conversations. It's very much been engineering driven by, you know, Siva and folks, and I've had, like, one conversation with SIVA and, you know, so I'm kind of a little worried that the direction of it is actually handy, heading into a place where it can be real and do real things in a in a relatively realistic timeframe.\n\nSpeaker 2  4:24 I don't I don't disagree with you about how Zora operates.

So I know I never got a really good answer to that. And in it, in addition to that, there was this problem that you have this, you have this three tiered engineering and product swim lanes, or three, three swim lanes of product development. And what was very hard to understand is, how do these things actually connect with each other? You know, how in the market, you know, if you put this in front of a salesperson, how are they going to understand the use cases? Is the boundary sales force, you know, is it headless? Is it solving for the spreadsheet? So I think there's a lot of those, you know. How is vibe quoting? To me, seems like you know, for someone that is relatively new to CPQ, sounds like a really cool idea. But when you go and talk to people about what's one of the most important things about CPQ, they'll talk of compliance, right? And and so on one side, you've got solving for the spreadsheet. And the argument is, well, the spreadsheet doesn't have any compliance, that's fine. Are we just building, you know, we're building a better spreadsheet. We're building a better spreadsheet experience. But if you're a fully blown CPQ, then you have to alter at some point answer the question, well, where does compliance come in? And some of the answers I got is, well, we'll push five quoting to CPQ, and then that's where the compliance will will live. Problem with that is when you actually think about the user experience. If every time you push something to CPQ and it says, hey, it's not compliant, you're very quickly going to stop using vibe quoting because it doesn't consume the variables that you need to tell you whether or not you're heading in the right the right direction. You know, am I? Am I vibe quoting something that's compliant or non compliant? Because if I keep pressing push the CPQ and it tells me it's non compliant, then I just becomes, I might as well just work in in a spreadsheet and then build it out and CPQ once with all of the compliance baked into it. So, yeah, I\n\nSpeaker 1  7:01 mean and, and hope, right, that CPQ, the tool that I actually use, that follows the rules, will get better, so that I can do that more efficiently, correct, which is where our customers are today, and yet we're focusing on this, you know, thing that's probably, you know, far ahead of where we need to be focusing to create this kind of appeal in the market that I think is more superficial, yeah,\n\nUnknown Speaker  7:27 I think, I think there's um,\n\nSpeaker 2  7:32 people, human beings are pretty simple things, right? So that the superficial bit serves a function. You know, it's, it's the fairy dust, you know, I came from selling AI in 2018 before it was a real thing. And the fairy, fairy dust matters, right?

    "content": "a chap called Michael Belkin, who runs our PE sales motion, you know, Michael, right. And he was super interested in the focus on CPQ because it's a story he wants to tell to the PE firms, in addition to omni channel. And so he thinks of omni channel as, you know, the point at the kind of point solutions of self serve and sales LED. But he's really interested in the growth story of, how do you go from self serve to sales led, and how do you go from sales led back to self serve? And in the middle there's this kind of whether it's agent assisted or service sales assisted motion, which can be a version of or a degree of complexity around CPQ. Now for me, CPQ feels quite elastic when I begin. I don't need a very complex CPQ. I may never need a very complex CPQ, but equally, I may need, I may need that complexity at some point in the future. I guess the obvious question that I keep coming back to and again, this is with probably partial knowledge is, why do we think of quote studio and quote pad, as I often hear them as separate things, and I would have thought, well, quote pad is headless, you know, it just doesn't Live in CPQ. It could be in CPQ in Salesforce, but it could also be anywhere. It could be a standalone product. It could be dropped into any environment. CPQ is heavily bound in the way people think about it, to Salesforce, and I just, I don't know if you could maybe just give me a sense of of, did we? Did we take studio and say, Hey, can we? Can we make it headless and and it became quote pad, someone just put a name on it. Or did we say we need a different experience to Stu studio is the gold standard, but we just need a different way of customers interacting with it. How has it been played out to you? What's your understanding?\n\nSpeaker 1  10:13 That's a really good question. I actually don't really know how we've gotten to where we've gotten my only assumption is that it's through a desire to appeal upper leadership in creating a marketable vision of CPQ that is better than what we have today. And so that means that, instead of because, I mean, look, I'll be honest, and I told this to Manfred into his face many times, like he doesn't know our CPQ at all. He doesn't know it backwards or forward. He doesn't know he very rarely can get in there and do anything and Satish much better. But he's also only been here a year, so he kind of lacks the depth of the pain that CPQ customers have felt for the last 15 years, and what we've done to alleviate that pain over time, and instead, what I'm seeing at least, is that there is a push of demand, both from, you know, Silver Lake and from Pete and obviously from teen to say, like, Well, look, if CPQ so important, why has our revenue not grown in CPQ for 10 years? Why has it stayed at 11 million? Why do we lose as many customers as we gain? Why can't we sell be",

And it's and they're valid questions, you know, and maybe that ends up falling on me, since Manfred Institute haven't been here that long, because I haven't been able to really break through the glass ceiling. But what I think has happened is, instead of trying to deeply understand the things that we can do better and where we struggle to achieve those things, we've decided to take a new spin, because it's easier to build something that is completely separate from the thing we have. As you know, right? You're not dealing with old debt, you're not dealing with tight integrations, you're not dealing with all of the complexity that comes with this deep, deep historical knowledge of what our system does. And we can name it something different. We can make it flashy. We can say it uses AI. And we've solved three of the four problems, the fourth problem being, how do we make it real? And that ends up falling to me when we sell the dream, and then I have to figure out how to actually make it work.\n\nSpeaker 2  12:21 But let me ask, let me ask you that question. So maybe, maybe to some degree, playing devil's advocate. In fact, no, let me go back and ask the question about Salesforce versus headless, right? Sure. So you have to have Salesforce to have cpqx Correct,\n\nUnknown Speaker  12:41 yes. And you also have to have Zor billing, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2  12:46 in in next generation, because it's headless, you don't need to be in Salesforce, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1  12:55 But that's never been a problem. I mean, if you think about the amount of prospects and existing customers that we have in our pipeline, or currently, the vast majority use Salesforce, right? So it's never been a question of we will increase our market addressability by getting out of Salesforce. Yeah, right.\n\nUnknown Speaker  13:21 I agree. I agree with that. I think\n\nUnknown Speaker  13:25 again, this may be somewhat\n\nSpeaker 2  13:28 reductive, because I am still learning. But if I was going to go and if well in building omni channel and being able to go to the sales team and say, you can now begin. Doesn't matter where you are in the world. You can now begin to sell self serve to $100 million SARS company. Or you can sell a bit of, you know, a sales agent assisted, or sales assisted, or service rep assisted cell, which is a light CPQ, or will grow you into a full CPQ, will take you through to sales. Led to me that would be done not best with Salesforce, right? Because the assumption is that you have to be in Salesforce. And a lot of these prospects, if we wanted to widen the net, would not be Salesforce. So I think I'm not looking much further for justification than forget what, what, what it does. But I'm not looking further than if you need to buy Salesforce or have Salesforce to use our Cbq, that feels like a limiting factor.\n\nSpeaker 1  14:45 Yeah, and it is 100% and if you're thinking more broadly for omni channel, like 100% I agree with you, it is. It is much more of a broadening or widening of the net. If you can say that we have omni channel that does not rely on Salesforce. But I guess that's not the conversation that I'm really thinking about. It's more of the conversation of we have a CPQ. We don't consider it best in class, even though we could probably make the case for it if anyone at zord decided to learn more about how our CPQ works, and we get the marketing support for that. But what we need to do is optimise certain elements of CPQ in Salesforce, how it works in Salesforce, how it works today, I guess I should say. And the way to do that is to actually not build on the Salesforce platform, and then we have a series of services that can enable and inform a true omni channel experience, or a non sales sales force based voting experience, but they can still inform the Salesforce based quoting experience, which is where we've cut our teeth on learning what it means to quote for subscriptions. And so that's the piece that I'm really anchored in. Is saying we we know how to create an incredible voting experience for a multi year complex subscription, time based, order, activation based, sequence of changes, and then amend those and renew those, and do all of the fancy things that Salesforce constantly blunders.

Just audit, audit trail of our actual like, what users, we're not going to be a CR, right? I think that ship has sailed. But if we're going to bring sales teams into the Zor platform, there's a lot of infrastructure we still need to build. And I think that that is one of the things Siva recognises, and what he's decided to focus on as as far as how much he's he's doing for vibe coding, he's like, Well, we need to build this infrastructure first, and I do agree with that part, then we can get out of Salesforce, because the brains, the power, the processing, is not in Salesforce, and it's easier, and we can have light coding tools in Salesforce, as well as in other CRMs, as well as the omni channel, API led, Product Catalogue based.\n\nSpeaker 2  17:34 Support isn't, isn't, though, the work that's being done on the I the quote pad kind of comparative to that, though the pipes underneath, I would have thought, I mean, I'd be surprised if it wasn't the case. But the pipes underneath serve both CPQ and quote pad, or are you saying that there's two sets of pipes that are being built to set them?\n\nSpeaker 1  18:06 At the moment, nothing that works for quote pad or next gen, or whatever you want to call it is anything that CPQ can or does use my CPU. Salesforce, right? They've been building next gen for a year. I don't know what it does. I don't know how it works. I don't know where the infrastructure is right. I think in theory now, that is the messaging that we're that engineering is at least trying to push, that we're building the foundation for things that eventually both source existing CPQ and next gen can consume. But this is where I kind of got on Manfred earlier this week saying, you know, where is the definition from a functional and, you know, product led standpoint of what that is, what those foundations are. And he said, Well, that's an engineering decision. And I was like, the decision part, yes, but what they choose to decide to work on should be us, and we had a bit of a disagreement on it. He said, Well, look, well, let's let them take a first pass, and then we'll assess. And you know, to me, it just kind of feels like, I mean, I've been in every architectural conversation that Zora Cbq has had for the last seven years. And from my experience, engineering makes architectural decisions, lacking functional understanding of the big picture. Without product p",

I start with the story, then I go and translate the story to the engineering teams I don't even get I typically want to. And as a product person, what you have to do is you have to get people, engineers lined up to the way you're thinking before they write a single TDD. And it's even before you write the PRD, it just they have to just think about the way you're thinking. And if the first principle is, what we build is universal, then that's the first principle. If the first principle is, we're not going to ever merge these, they're going to remain permanently forked or split. Not even forked. It sounds like they're just completely parallel engineering tracks. Then that's another way of thinking about it. My, my, I guess, my, my, if you were to land and think about this without any knowledge of CPQ, what you would, I think, assume, if you looked at the engineering investment and focus, is that at some point the business plans to, I'm not saying this is a fact. I'm just saying from an external perspective, view lens that you would assume that the business is planning to at some point in the future, sunset, CPQ inside Salesforce, if the investment is not there, if the joined up thinking is not there, if the if the strategy about what does CPQ in Salesforce look like when we have next gen CPQ?

For example, if I'm in Salesforce, and I have Salesforce CPQ, there is going to be a point, there's going to be a period of time where quote pad does not stand up next to quote studio. There may be a point in the future where quote pad is on par with quote studio. My question is, what do you tell a Salesforce CPQ customer at that point?\n\nSpeaker 1  22:18 Well, that's, I think that that's the question that so far I have not seen engineer try to answer, which is, what's the path and the journey? And this goes back to what you said about getting everyone to think about the problems the way you're thinking about them. What's the journey for taking 380 customers with well over $100 million of revenue to Zora, right? Not necessarily Cbq specifically, obviously, but to Zora that says, like, they need this. They need Cbq. They've been using it for five to 10 years, and now we've got this whole new thing. We've stopped investing in the existing thing, and there is now no real clear understanding of what the migration journey is. There's not a quick switch over there never will be. There's not very even much a plan of the pieces and components that need to be translated and how, right? And then when you never really did that work. And so now we're left with, Okay, well, we can sell to the new market. Great, but now there's, you know, $8 million $9 million of CPQ existing revenue, plus however much revenue is impacted from zora's billing system that people are like, well, this, we can't use this. So we're going to find a different billing system that's, you know, this is almost like, it's almost like the flaws in what RCA has done, we are replicating with our mindset, or engineering mindset, to say, let's just build this new thing, because it's easier to think\n\nSpeaker 2  23:49 about, Yeah, correct. It's like, lift and shift. You just go, okay with Let's Move the story over here. It's very it's not dissimilar to catalogue, not because we have, you know, we have this kind of legacy catalogue. And I've been in a number of conversations with customers recently because I just wanted to hear how this is sold. But they go, we've got the existing catalogue. How do we get to the new catalogue? No one has no one has an answer.\n\nSpeaker 1  24:14 No one has a clue. I've asked that question 20 times in 20 different scenarios.\n\nSpeaker 2  24:19 What there is, though, there is a there is a pattern, right?

So I think I It's been bothering me. So what you're saying to me does not surprise me. I think, I think, and I've said this to Manfred, I think Manfred probably has a\n\nUnknown Speaker  24:57 higher confidence in engineering decisions than I do,\n\nSpeaker 1  25:02 very much more than I do as well, and it's one of the points of contention between me and him,\n\nSpeaker 2  25:06 yeah, because I believe that engineering is at the service of product, agreed, but product has to understand how to work with engineering. You know, you have to bring people along on a vision. If you don't have the vision, then they will make it's like children. They will make decisions given the information they have, because it's not their job to solve the problem between CPQ in Salesforce and next gen. It's it's not their job to build that if that's not what they're asked to do. So let me just ask you a few other questions, because I do want to see the day. Want to see the demo, sure, and I've read most of the documentation on next gen and CPQ that that you share with me, so that's been super helpful. But I wanted to ask about the investment thinking on CPQ. My summary from what you told me, is that we are not investing in the way that you think we should in order to maintain best in class, CPQ inside Salesforce. That's number one. Part one of the question. Part Two of the question is, if Salesforce themselves, although they've bungled it. Are moving the conversation to RCA. Is there a risk that CPQ in Salesforce, the Zora CPQ in Salesforce, is tarred with the same legacy brush that Salesforce seem to have painted their own CPQ with,\n\nUnknown Speaker  26:45 yeah, I'll answer the first question. First,\n\nSpeaker 1  26:49 do I think that our investment in next gen and in CPQ in general is not entirely, you know, being done the right way to kind of serve the existing customer base and the existing CPQ, the answer, short answer to that, yes. But I think engineering is a little bit of a black box right now, and I think that Satish having, you know, now, being pulled into the ear of a teen as well as Siva, like their their focus is very much more appeasing an unfounded dream, right? Versus figuring out what it's going to take to move 380 customers to a new CPQ that also solves some of the problems of the old CPQ in terms of how the performance and the scalability worked. And no one's really asking those questions or thinking about that, and I think that Manfred is also failing to position that as the first and biggest problem, like, if we're going to do this, the whole point of it is so that we can get better processing and performance and experience out of existing CPQ,",

Second answer\n\nSpeaker 2  28:03 is, I just want to go back to the first answer. Okay, in your opinion, you have eight engineers, or six engineers dedicated to CPQ Salesforce,\n\nSpeaker 1  28:14 or no, there was, there was 18. Now there will be 15.\n\nSpeaker 2  28:19 Oh, there's 15. All right, don't know why. Oh no, maybe, yeah. Well, so maybe\n\nSpeaker 1  28:22 three of generation. They poke. They put three of them from our team, from Bay team, they move those three. So now we have 15 on to next gen. Okay, and now I think next gen has eight.\n\nSpeaker 2  28:32 So, so core, CPQ, CPQ, x, what do\n\nUnknown Speaker  28:41 we call it? CPQ in Salesforce? Cpqx, course.\n\nUnknown Speaker  28:44 I just call it Zora CPQ, nothing else exists.\n\nUnknown Speaker  28:47 Let's do that. Sora CPQ, yeah, I agree with you. Okay, much easier.\n\nSpeaker 2  28:52 Oh, we have 15 engineers working on Zora CPQ, what?\n\nUnknown Speaker  28:58\n\nWhat do they do?\n\nSpeaker 1  29:02 Yes, great question. So the last year and a half, and this is where I commend Satish, has been spent, and really honestly, the last four years has been spent slowly trickling forward with cpqx, right, quote, studio innovation, but really just getting hammered by the constant health threes, bugs, changes to Billing APIs that impact us, changes to the Salesforce platform that impacts us, Salesforce security review accommodations we had to make. And just like bugs of legacy code from features that are 10 years old, that maybe two customers use, or some mix of all of the above, where it's like we've done some customization using existing programmatic means with Salesforce platform and CPUs methods and something broke and we don't know what it is, and now we're just troubleshooting, and support can't handle that level of troubleshooting, and our engineers are dealing with stuff that they've never even seen because they're features that were built 15 years ago. So in the last year and a half, what I commenced to teach on is like building more rigorous testing and automation, you know, processes in the team to reduce some of that noise, and it has. And then what we're also been doing is basically putting less and less and less emphasis on fixing the sins of our fathers so that customers have recognised that they just need to start modernising and upgrading, because the stuff of the past will not work forever. And we fixed, we've our focus is to fix the stuff of the past in the new thing first. Even if it's not being complained about in the new thing, right, in, quote, studio, we fix it first. It's like, hey, look, there is an answer. It's there, but we'll, we'll see, maybe in a month, we'll get to fix in the same past.\n\nUnknown Speaker  30:47\n\nSo have we done\n\nSpeaker 1  30:49 now too? With last part of this is we're in the last six months, there's been a huge amount of noise around building parity, to all of the billing things that are being done. And that noise has been amplified by a handful of customers who have had our roadmap in their pockets. Trade with gwilio, percent span commitments, dynamic pricing, right? Which some of the things align wit",

And so when we spend as much time as we're spending on those kind of like your dream shot, like compatibility things with billing that billings doing, also as a dream shot, we're losing focus on building out, like, all of the things that could make CPQ a better CPQ, and instead we can say, Oh, well, we support flexible commitments. It's like, well, no one's using that, or one customers using that. What about the 100 customers who want a guided selling, or the 200 customers who want opportunity product syncing, right? Like, that's where we're just not prioritising the right things, in my opinion. So anyways, that's what the rest, that's what the other that's what the team is doing, aside from the L threes and the fires and maintenance, is building these kind of dream shot items,\n\nUnknown Speaker  32:09 where we slow trickle out the things that we actually should be building.\n\nSpeaker 2  32:14 And is, there is the environment in Salesforce.\n\nUnknown Speaker  32:19 You talked about this, this idea of\n\nSpeaker 2  32:23 an architecture that serves both next generation and CPQ, if you think about guided selling, is that a reality to today to focus on? What would the engineering team have to think about,\n\nSpeaker 1  32:42 are they? Yeah? You're talking about as a solution that's held outside of Yeah, because\n\nSpeaker 2  32:49 the pattern you just described is never going to go away. You'll have 15 engineers. And the longer life you know, the longer this goes on, the harder it gets. It never gets easier. So, so there are some decisions. They're almost unrelated to the to the CPQ as a product. They just wonder, what do we want to be as a commerce business, right? Do we want to be constantly doing this? If we do then we just keep, keep doing it till it becomes end of life. And then those engineers, yeah, those engineers,\n\nUnknown Speaker  33:24 one step forward, 10 steps back, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2  33:26 like, like, it doesn't feel like you can just continue going on like that. So I guess, I guess what, I guess what I'm interested in,\n\nUnknown Speaker  33:39 what I'm interested in is,\n\nSpeaker 2  33:45 why would we not emphasise building a unified architecture, where what we invest in next generation also enables studio that I'm just struggling\n\nSpeaker 1  34:01 so I think that's the I think that's the goal now, which it took us a year to some for someone to kind of get that. That's the goal. I don't know who. I don't know if it was P I don't know if it was nav, I don't know if it was Siva and nav. I don't know if it was Manfred and nav. I don't know. I haven't been involved, right? I got pigeon holed into being the guy who knows everything about the existing CPQ, so I'll keep fighting those fires, and then we'll hire a new director of CPQ, and he's going to do everything else, since he can't learn what I know in the next six months or a year, whatever. And so now I'm like, I'm not in those conversations, but for one year, they've been ongoing, and I still have yet to see any meaningful thing that will take us in that direction. Okay, I don't, and maybe they exist.\n\nSpeaker 2  34:44 I don't. I don't understand that. So I'm gonna, well, I'm gonna take that away. I need to understand that. But that's not, you know, I've spent a lot of time with NAV, nav and I are trying to build this unified view of commerce to abstract out this intersection layer that I talked about, which is we've got this, this orchestration layer that we're trying to build that gives us the bones of omni channel.

What? Prior, first, prioritising, what are the biggest bang, things that can be built outside of the Salesforce platform that can be utilised by the existing source, CPQ, as well as by next gen at some point.

I mean, they've spent six years working on this thing, and, you know, there's been a lot of brains behind it for the last 15 years in terms of getting us ultimate to where we are today. But the customers like it. Like, if you talk to zoom, talk to BMC, like, they're like, this is, this is absolutely great for the things we needed to do. Sure, there's always more things they wanted to do. But like, go to any other CPQ that Zoom, went to big machines, went to Oracle, did a million dollar POC because they were like, see, sales floor CPQ is kind of like, it's not it's not full bait, it's not fully baked. And they did a million dollar POC to find out that it costs them 5 million a year and still not meet all the things that source CPQ does today for 20,000 a year that they pay us for. And so they're like, Okay, well, you know, let's not lose our jobs in the sales ops and, you know, for this fight BMC, you know, same kind of story. They came from a homegrown tool, right? It's either homegrown or it's another CPQ out there that someone thinks it's going to be better and it's not going to solve us, or CPQ solves yet we are not thinking of ourselves as a first class citizen.\n\nUnknown Speaker  37:48 Well, yeah, but that's the data's\n\nSpeaker 2  37:52 contrary to that. You know, you've got evidence that says these POCs were done. When the POC is complete, the customer comes back and they use the product that, that, that we've built. So I want to understand is, where does the story come around? Zora CPQ\n\nUnknown Speaker  38:14 not being a market leading product.\n\nSpeaker 1  38:19 The biggest part of that story comes from when Gartner changed the criteria for inclusion in the CPQ Magic Quadrant. That happened about three years ago. And the primary piece of criteria that excluded us was that you had to have a native configuration element, which is the c part of CPQ. And we, I was told to go to London for a week to talk to Mark Lewis in a room. And the end of that conversation, after, after everything we did to try to convince him that what we are doing is configuration in the SAS subscription based world, he didn't see it as configuration, because his definition of configuration was really more based on hardware configuration, right, a bill of materials, creating a sequence of items that can be interchanged with each other to ultimately build out a plane engine or something. And you know, we lost that battle. We got excluded. And in the exclusion, we were like, okay, internally, Zora CPQ wasn't up to snuff, and now we need to do something to change that, and that's kind of where we've landed today.\n\nSpeaker 2  39:24 Now, yeah, are we? Are we? Is there any investment in the sea, or is this just a structural problem that we're not interested in?\n\nSpeaker 1  39:32 The part was the c part was product catalogue. You can't ask us the way we are tightly coupled to the entire billing ecosystem. You cannot ask CPQ to allow configuration if the building blocks that CPQ uses are entirely rigid, product, rate, p",

And so we got charged with that failure right in CPQ, saying we can't Configure.\n\nSpeaker 2  40:07 What about configurable bundles, though? Because configurable bundles seems to be talked about in the context of next gen, but I haven't heard it talked about in the context of CPQ. Cause or CPQ,\n\nSpeaker 1  40:21 no, it will be, it will be supported in scores or so. So hard bundle is the first step right, and that'll be supported in q1 in existing CPQ. Configurable bundles is still being worked out as a catalogue, but it will also be supported in existing CPQ. How they use that to build configuration as a true C experience in next gen will is also, I guess, meant for somewhat thinking of that I've just been less in that picture\n\nSpeaker 2  40:52 well, but how do you bring the C back to Mark Lewis's point with what, what this More With, with what the more flexible catalogue does.\n\nUnknown Speaker  41:03 How do you bring it back?\n\nSpeaker 2  41:05 So, how do you be the sea again? How do you bring the configuration?\n\nSpeaker 1  41:11 So once, once, the catalogue has constructs that let at the time of ordering or quoting right? Let you build them out right. Let you decide what should and should not be put together given some rules. And if you get into this arrows long term, dream of context rules, and you have a really true omni channel experience. But once you get to that point where there are constructs that can be configurably combined at the time of ordering, not just as a product catalogue managers job to do whenever right, then you bring the c into c, p, q, because then a sales rep, given some constraints played on him by his admin through configuration at the billing or, sorry, through setting configuration that CPQ lets you have right that sales rep can say, Okay, I want you know c1 c3 from over here, from another rate plan, and c2 from this bundle over here to be combined into this one thing that I'm selling, this offer, this package, this configurable bundle. Now I've just configured a three component item and given it a unique, you know, set of pricing for the three components, or if you talk about what customers really want from an ease of use standpoint, is like this magic, like bundle, line, price, and then I've configured it at the point of sale, so only this customer has that configuration, and we've sold it to them.

Well, we did, I think we did, but it, but it, but it took two years.\n\nSpeaker 2  44:01 Yeah, but see is not we're out of the Magic Quadrant because, because Mark Lewis thinks we have no C, right, correct. So why don't we get our C back?\n\nUnknown Speaker  44:15 We are, I don't understand the question, because I guess what\n\nSpeaker 2  44:18 I'm saying is we're out. That's what arrow got hired for, yeah, yeah, but\n\nUnknown Speaker  44:25 is that a if you're not involved in the\n\nSpeaker 2  44:33 configurable bundles story, right? So, so there's hard and soft bundles, really, what they are is just pre configured and configurable. Right, correct. I don't understand why we use the words hard and soft, but they're pre configured or configurable. What you've just described to me is that if I have the substrate in the catalogue of pre configured and configurable, that is what I need to be. A true in Mark Lewis's language, CPQ. Is that accurate?\n\nSpeaker 1  45:05 It's the first it's the first step. Yes. What would be the other things, features and entitlements, which is also on on the play out? Yeah, guided selling is the last piece.\n\nSpeaker 2  45:14 Okay, so, so if we just take guided selling and put it to the left one second. Yep, we know that the the features and entitlements, which is, is rules, is also, well, rules we're building at the moment in this, in this, what we call this arbiter layer, which is a rules engine, slash orchestration. This is something that I'm seeing a POC on tomorrow. So let's just take the soup of what you've just just described, which is I have configured, pre configured and configurable bundles. I have rules, and I have features and entitlements, and then I have guided selling, right? So if, if I put guided selling to one side, it sounds like we have a four out of five package there that gets you back to the C right. Yeah. Okay, so that\n\nSpeaker 1  46:11 totally once, once we deliver it in q2 if it gets in q2 then we have a strong story to get back included in the Magic Quadrant. O",

    "content": "ay, so now it's a moving target, though, because then they change their criteria from year to year. They kind of build ad criteria. And so I think they might have added criteria in the last couple of years where they're saying, now a native e commerce, or, you know, non assisted sales solution, like, should be a baked in concept of CPQ, right? Like, where you should have an element to where you can create a commerce portal that drops in a quote, well, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  46:52 That's being built on experiences. I think the problem in here is that\n\nSpeaker 1  46:56 there are, well, it's not whatever is building built in experiences isn't going to create a quote.\n\nSpeaker 2  47:01 No, it won't create a quote. It's but it will create the experience around the quote. So what I'm trying to understand is, you know, there are, there are probably these, these joins that exist somewhere across all of these road maps, right? 100% right? So my job is to try and find out where that connective tissue is. So if you said to me, Listen, what I would love to do is I would love at the end of 2026 to be able to say that we think we're ready for prime time again. In the context of Magic Quadrant, not the product. They just think about the share of mine there, right? So, we deliver next gen. We deliver this we I'll go, I'm going to have conversations with Satish and Siva specifically on the unified engineering principles. You know, give me a give me a use case. Go, give me an example. Why building without a universal framework is a good thing, right? Like, if I'm going to build a thing, it should serve CPQ, core CPQ and it should serve next gen. Why is that not possible? Is it that the managed packages, which is what I understand, is the thing that you need for Salesforce, such a limiting constraint that you can't do that, or is it, can you really go down to the the ground, you know, to the basement, and say, we build that, and then we have to, then we have to do some stuff on the edges for CPQ, and we have to do some stuff over there for next gen, and they're just slightly different. That's that that hasn't been explained to me, but, but I'm thinking that as a North Star, because, again, this is also an engineering principle. If, if we said we're going to get back in the Magic Quadrant, and we're going to get back there because of the C, because the, you know, the P and the Q is fine. I mean, guided selling, you know, putting to one side, because I don't have an answer for that right now. But why would we not? Why would we not do that?\n\nSpeaker 1  49:09 Yeah, there's no reason why we shouldn't do that. I think it's I think the answer you're probably going to get from engineering is that we have been doing that, but it's taken longer than expected, because we've been dealing with tech debt in the catalogue. We've been dealing with architectural constraints. I think that the piece you're going to lean into, or that you probably should lean in, lean into, is, you know, if we're building anything, it should it should be supported. Should support the existing CPQ and next gen, right? But where I am struggling to connect the dots with the amount of you know, I guess visibility I've had into this, this kind of black box that is the CPQ next gen world is, are they even thinking about creating tools or processes or services or performance related improvements in core service, the core Zora service that can be used by Zora CPQ, or are they not thinking about it at all? Because what you said, it's too much of a sales force is holding it too tightly. It's too much of its own black box because we don't have access to the data, or we can't create the data. And I think some of that stuff we could",

They're not perfect. They can definitely be improved upon. But ultimately, if we got some, you know, API call from the Zora core service that says, hey, build this construct, we could do that like that could be built out, right? There's the bones are there, you know, but I don't know if they're thinking about it that way. And I think that that's where I'm struggling to understand, is everything I've heard has gone for one year like this, to the point where now it's kind of somewhat getting closer to aligning to what I thought we were doing from the very beginning, which is, again, building services that store Cbq could use,\n\nSpeaker 2  51:19 yeah, but, but there's a there's a way to kind of move people to this type of conversation. So first of all, I don't see any rationale for not having an answer to that. You not having an answer to that, even if the answer is we're not going to do it, you need to know why we're not going to do\n\nSpeaker 1  51:41 it, that would be my preference. Yeah, the Yeah. What's the benefit of not doing it? Yeah?\n\nSpeaker 2  51:46 So, like, what's the trade off? Yeah, exactly. At least you have a point, you know, something to focus on and say, Okay, I get that. It's a valid argument. I understand it.\n\nUnknown Speaker  51:55 The bit that I don't understand, though, is,\n\nSpeaker 2  51:59 well, I do understand it. Let me frame this another way. If I was to say at the top of a conversation that I want us back in the Magic Quadrant, right? If you just think about that as a forcing function, I want us back in the Magic Quadrant, what I understand is that the majority of what would get us back into the magic quadrant is already in play, somewhere in the business, somewhere in the commerce business, guided selling, I think, is from memory, I'd have to go back and check, but I think guided selling is also a core part of next gen. But I'll let me not say that that's the truth. I mean, I think I just know,\n\nSpeaker 1  52:40 I mean, that is something that Manfred has said is very important, but I will say that no one other than Manfred knows in the next gen team knows what guided selling is. So Zora CPQ has. Zora CPQ today has a guided selling. We go guided selling like seven years ago, eight years ago. The problem is we didn't get the bandwidth to rebuild it in the modernised, quote studio. So we did something else that was lighter. You've got it faster to build it there. We got a legacy, Legacy feature, and it can be used with the new feature, but it's kind of disjointed. And I can, I can walk you through that stuff that's a little bit more of an advanced demo. I can walk you through that stuff if you want to see it. But see it. But you know that. We know what guided selling is to our customers, right? We know what we need for it, but we have not prioritised it because of all of the chaos in what we've been told to do for billing support, of features for now, next gen support,\n\nSpeaker 2  53:38 because now there's no North Star. There's no North Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1  53:42 Insert flashy feature here. Rally, yeah, people around it. No one else knows what they're doing.\n\nSpeaker 2  53:48 But this is, this is my point is that if you think about the if you think about our next generation, CPQ, either you have",

We're going to deprecate or we're going to not support CPQ in court. I'm not saying that's the truth. You just say that's what we're going to do. And that means we're not building any new flashy stuff. We will give it two years and we will retire. No one has mentioned that, but I'm just saying that that would be a way of framing it, right? Yeah, the other way of framing it is, we're going to build an underlying architecture when we build for next gen that enhances CPQ, because we know the Salesforce environment is as important as the headless, right? That's another position. And then you go, Well, if we have a really flashy next gen CPQ, why are we not in the Magic Quadrant in our core CPQ, right? Because the disjoint seems to be stark. How can you have a mature CPQ product and sales force that is not, you know, and no one cares about the explanation of why the sea doesn't work. It's just you're not in the magic quadrant. So if you're not in the magic quadrant over here, and I can see conga is, is in the Magic Quadrant, why is your next gen CPQ any better than your core foundational CPQ? I'd like, how do I\n\nSpeaker 1  55:17 sell question, if someone was smart, right? Like, in terms of, like, a customer, whoever was asking that question, what I would ask is, how much parity does your next gen CPQ have around your existing correct? And if you look at it right now, that's a very, very scary answer.\n\nSpeaker 2  55:35 That's a very it's a very good point. And then, because that, what happens is, that's the first question you ask is, is it is, is it better than next gen CPQ? And you go, actually, no, it's worse. Yeah, it doesn't happen, but it can do flashy things. Yeah, it's got this whole kind of AI thing, but it actually doesn't do what quote Studio does. Then the customer goes, Wait a minute. You're telling me this is next generation CPQ, but your core CPQ is better, and your core CPQ is not in the Magic Quadrant. Why is it not in the Magic Quadrant? Sales Team probably don't know that. They probably don't know that the nuance around the sea so that as a sales story, it falls flat instantly, right? Instantly. So what you've got is you've got a team of people who are building from an engineering led motion, which is, let's build this stuff right? And then we'll figure out what the sales story is. The way I work is, what's the sales story? Then what the engineering principles that you need to deliver the sales story? And then then you get to the middle and what flavour of the product you need is a function of those two things, right? You have to have the it's very interesting. Can we build the engineering so the question is, can we build a Unified Engineering strategy for CPQ? If we can't, then that is question number one answered, okay, if we can't What? What does it require? Well, it requires two teams. That's perfectly fine. We've got two teams. But when you've got those TT, two teams working together, when you've built next generation CPQ, which will not be as good as CPQ out of the box, how do you then explain that to the marketplace? What is next generation? CPQ, is it? Is it? It? So that this story does not stack up, and so my\n\nSpeaker 1  57:29 question ve",

Like that could be the sales story correct, but it's, it's\n\nSpeaker 2  57:50 often the sales story is often lost when the AE, who knows not that much about CPQ, right, cannot answer a very simple question, which is that story? Why is it better? Why is Why is CPQ, core, CPQ, better than next gen? CPQ is called next generation, right? We called it next generation, but it's not as good as the first generation. And then the other thing is, why are you not in the Magic Quadrant, which, which causes the whole with either of them, with either of them. So, so, yeah, looks brilliant. Good. So I tell you what I would like to do. So let me just tell you the way I would approach this is I'm not making any commitments because I need to kind of build this story arc with Satish and with Manfred, right? But I like the kernel of this, and if I was going to do this, I would focus people on one thing, right, like I would if I was going to go to Pete, and he says to me, what are you going to do with CPQ core? CPQ? I could tell him all the story about unified architecture, all that kind of stuff. I'm going to go and find out that story. But what I would like to say is CPQ will be back in the Magic Quadrant in the beginning of 27 then that's compelling, right? And that's it. And he compel, yeah? And he goes, how you gonna do that? And I go, Well, this is how we're gonna do that, right? So all this stuff,\n\nSpeaker 1  59:31 not just the magic bathroom, but like the upper right corner, yeah, we want\n\nSpeaker 2  59:35 to be if you want to sell everything. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just on this call kiddo. Let me just finish this up, right? They're stunning.\n\nUnknown Speaker  59:45 Kids. Having an 11 year old, you don't have kids,\n\nSpeaker 3  59:49 do you? I've got a two year old so little different, still chaotic. Girl or boy, boy, okay? 11 year old girls, until I grew up, I grew up with three sisters,\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:00:06\n\nis it? Yeah,\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:00:09 the dress sense and the hormones is just like insane.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:00:13 So, yeah, I would like to be able to just focus on one thing, because typically, you know, it's like a Christmas tree, if you start with we know that we want to be in the top right. Magic Quadrant is a big thing, but you've articulated the things that you need to get there. None of those things are new. They are things that are being built in catalogue. There's probably not enough concept around what catalogue does and what next gen consumes from catalogue. Because the way I've heard it is, here's the things that I'm dependent on for catalogue, and they're the unlock for next gen, not what I've not heard is those things are also consumed by CPQ, and they are part of the problem which drove my, you know, the Gartner, to remove us from the from the Magic Quadrant, because we didn't have to see so that's the story that I'm going to internalise, and I'm going to battle test that I might have some time tomorrow, but then I'm on leave till January. But what I would love to do is, is embed that as the strategy for next year is make CPQ a Magic Quadrant contender again,\n\nSpeaker 1  1:01:33 love it, appreciate it. And I'd be on board, yeah, to help in whatever way I can.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:01:38 And then, and then what we do, and again, I have to talk to Manfred about this is then you start to cut, cull the noise, and say, well, in order to get to that o",

So you have to build a case that says, if you want this, you can't have this at the moment this, this doesn't exist. And so that always wins.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:02:13 I am curious, and I you know, I've told this to Manfred, and I'm pretty sure Manfred agrees and has told this, maybe, to you, definitely, to Shakir, is, we've been, we've got plenty of engineering capacity, right? But from a pm standpoint, it's basically, you know, 2pm to 18 engineers. Or if you think about it, with next gen two PMS to 25 engineers or so like we can't get enough breathing room to do anything other than survive. And so Manfred has been surviving in the space of trying to create the vision, trying to align the leadership. And I've been surviving in the space that I have been for six years before Manfred is just keeping up with everything. So the billing team, which we have to meet parity with everything they build, four PMS, five PMS, now, right? And every time one of them builds something, I have to go and ask them, Hey, what did you build? How does this work? Okay, I gotta build something to support that. Okay? And then now commerce Foundation is doing it, and then rating does something, and then tax does something, and it's like we're split in a million directions, right?\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:03:25 Yeah, but the the issue is, is there is no\n\nSpeaker 2  1:03:34 it's very hard to push back on that, because parity is important. But it doesn't have a trade off. It is the it is an objective that doesn't cannot be argued against, right? Because that parity actually within seat, within zero generally ism is a major problem, right? If you, if you do stuff, it has to work everywhere, and it's probably especially in CPQ. But the question is resource, and the question is direction. And when I look at what Silver Lake wants, when I look at what the MBRs talk about, CPQ is one of five things where we expect to make significantly more money next year. Right now, part of that is we're charging too little for even the thing that we've got today, right? But imagine if you go to the board and you say, actually we can do three times what we think we can do by building CPQ into the Magic Quadrant by building foundational engineering principles that support both CPQ and next gen, by ensuring that when we land with next gen, before shooting, you know, going too early, that It is on par And effectively, then being able to go to market and say, Listen, if you want the Salesforce flavour, it's magic quadrant. If you want the next gen headless flavour, it's on par with with studio, we have a best in class, CPQ experience, wherever you want it, right? That's the That's how the story should play out. Now, I agree.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:05:24 Yeah, I agree. I guess I I feel like all of those things also still need the pm support that we just kind of don't really have at the moment, unless I can completely stop focusing on any immediate demand from trade web, Twilio BMC, insert large customer here, right?

The thing is, when you get up in the morning, yeah, someone needs to tell you what is the job to be done, right? So if you go we're going to go north star, and that's the big strategy. Then we go in that direction, and then the trade offs are clear. We're making that that trade off in service of that trade off. If the business comes back to you, to me and says, Actually, we're just not going to invest in CPQ like that. We don't actually care if it's in the Magic Quadrant. That would be good for you to know right now, you might then go, well, actually, if that's going to happen, my career move is, I want to be more involved in next generation. Now, what concerns me is that you're not involved in next generation. You have a, clearly, a substantial amount of knowledge, and you articulate it super well. So I, what I strongly believe in is know what the real direction of travel is. And to do that, you have to force the leadership to make a decision. And so what you have to do is to present them with the sick. For you know, decisions that need to be made if we're going to have CPQ and in Salesforce, why would it not be magic quadrant? In order to get it to Magic Quadrant, it has to have these things. In order to have these things, we need a catalogue which we've got. But in order for that to happen, we need to be very critical about what the L threes are. What are the AOCs that we're supporting? What does parity mean? How do you know what is the support that we can get from the billing team to help us manage what parity, how parity is actually achieved, all of these types of things. So I think what's happening is, is the CPQ strategy has been fragmented across a whole bunch of different requirements. Not not not product requirements, but just, it's just demands. Yeah, demands, that's the word. It's been fragmented by demands. And so if this has been really, really helpful, I'd still like to see the demo I've got. Unfortunately, I've got a call in 20 minutes. I can give you 20 minutes worth of demo. Yeah, I'll tell you what. I've got a very good idea, direction of travel. I'll tell you so you're clear about what I'm going to do. Let's you and I keep this conversation between us right. Sure. I'm going to replay versions of this to Manfred and to Satish and to Errol as well, because I'd like his input, and then Siva. And I'm going to do that over the next two to three weeks, so probably take us through to the middle of or early part of January.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:08:39 And you should also probably add nav to that\n\nSpeaker 2  1:08:42 list, and I'm actually speaking to NAV tomorrow, so I'll include the some of these questions, and there'll be simple questions like, why are we not aiming for Magic Quadrant like that opens up a really useful can of worms. And then I think I'll be able to come back to you with a very precise direction, and I strongly suspect that it will be making magic quadrant an objective. But let's see. Let's see if. Let's see if I can get there because I tangible. I can't, I can't see why we shouldn't get there. Let's, let's have a look at the demo. I'm really interested.

I'm going to just go basic flows, add a little bit of flavour on the basic flows, and then kind of go through some of the settings and extra pieces that, you know, we'll run out of time on, and we can decide if you want to take it from there, you can build a so you manage package Salesforce ecosystem dances natively with the native objects. So this is an opportunity. Nice Salesforce object. Here's a new Quote button. It's new because this is quote studio versus the new Quote button. That's legacy. We can rename the buttons however we want. This is how I enter quote studio. Very first page of quote studio is what is called, and I might have been logged out here, not good is what's called the billing account selection and subscription selection page. It is a kind of like an intermediary step. What? Where are you quoting? Right? Because your opportunity can have multiple billing or Salesforce accounts, and you'll you need to decide, and now we have organisation support, and you need to decide where, where you're going this Okay, so we, I want to mention just you're going to see some latency and loading times. I have not opened this environment up yet today, and the very first load of the day is generally the slowest. Not saying that we're perfect, right? We do have slow loading times throughout sometimes that's based on Salesforce platform latency, and sometimes that's based on us. But in general, the first load is always going to be the slowest, and then the more features you have on right like right now I've got multi organisation enabled, which is a new feature and that now we're trying to process. Okay, well, what organisations do I need to show before I then load the accounts? So I've got access to nine organisations in Zora, my billing you my sales user here, so that's where I see all nine. And I get to choose, do I am I creating a new or a new quote for a new billing account on one of these orgs. Or am I going to create a quote for an existing subscription or an existing account on one of these orgs? So I'll go and fpic Acme US Central is the organisation I want to quote for now, I see two existing billing accounts, right? And my two existing billing accounts will filter out the subscriptions owned by each of the two billing accounts. So I can choose to quote for this Zora billing account, and I can choose to amend, renew or cancel one of these three subscriptions owned by that billing account, or the other way around, right? So that's kind of what these three buttons do here. Multi subscription quoting is another very advanced feature. It's big. It's what big BMC uses is what some of our biggest enterprise customers that have been drawn to Cbq have found a lot of appeal in. That's where I can choose multiple subscriptions to amend at the same time, or I can choose to create a new subscription, or a new multi subscription quote for a new billing account and create 345, up to 15. I think we just are expanding it to 60, and it's going to grow from there that subscriptions at the same time in one single quote that's really appealing to your global customers that are building a, you know, multi subscription deal across multiple GEOS, multiple currencies, right, whatever that is to them. And they build all that into a",

Okay, so I'm going to go simple new quote for this existing billing account.\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:13:03 And then we'll circle back into amend if we have time.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:13:08 So clicking the New Quote button takes me to what we call the quote studio. So the quote studio is your one stop shop for building everything that is required to get this to become an order in Zora and actually start bringing revenue in. You have at the top here, header level information, right? Just, you know, simply put, what you want to name, the quote when it's going to start. So I could decide that this is something that I want to actually create for January 1, right? Customers going to sign and they're going to be starting a new subscription on the first of the year, and that's what I'm going to align that date to. You can add any number of custom fields to either of these sections. You can change the names of these sections, and you can do all sorts of customization and configuration of how this looks right in terms of layout, not necessarily styling. The next section here, which I just expanded and so I can collapse this first one, if I'm done with it, is anything that you want to show your user in terms of what is required as information to input right terms and conditions. So simply, is this a termed or an evergreen, initial term renewal, terms period tight. You can automate the majority of this through default settings that we have no code needed. You just automate it so you can hide those fields, or you can restrict them to be read only in the UI, however you want it to be. So it's easier for your rep to fast, fast paced through things that are common, and then certain other profiles who maybe do uncommon things, they can have access to do these other things, right? I'm going to do a non ramp 36 month deal renewing for 12 months. And then, you know, this is just some of my basic account information, other field sets that we have for custom fields and different things. This is flexible billing support, all right, so being able to take attributes that are normally at the account level and bring them down to the subscription level, it's a billing feature we support, and that's your terms and conditions. Okay, so dropping down now I get to select my products. So product selection is either based on a, you know, search for the thing you want to add and add it right, or it's based on filtering the different items that you want to see and then selecting them. Now we have nested we have quick filters and we have product filters. Product filters are very basic, very simple. They're based on custom fields on the or standard fields on the product object in Zorro, and they just filter based on that. Now when you go and you look at quick filters, and I can show you the UI if we have time for configuring quick filters, but you have the ability to define filtering criteria, right? Conditionals, logic of how, what, what you're looking at in this, quote, everything, all the context. We have to decide what you want to see. So maybe you decide that you only want to see products for a specific geography, and you've got your pr",

    "content": "ducts given a custom field you can have, you know, a geo based filter here that would say this product is the only product you have that we sell in this geography. Because of your custom fields, we have nested filters, which is a kind of next level of that, where you can actually say, well, and none of No, I haven't actually configured any so you're not gonna see anything. But I could say my first filter is going to take my product catalogue, of, you know, 500 items, and filter it to 50 items. And then my second filter is going to take me from 50 to 25 and then if I had a third, I could go from 25 to five, and I could kind of narrow my way down. So this is a flavour, a very like, basic, like, first step towards what guided selling is, which is essentially being able to say, I have a series of decisions that my sales user needs to make, whether they're answers to questions, right, actually written questions, or whether they're just like, you know, data tags that then ultimately lands them in a series of five to 10, you know, products that they can select From that satisfy that flow of that guided selling. What this doesn't do, what quick filters doesn't do in guided selling, is that the whole catalogue is wide open from the beginning, and then you filter down guided selling says, No, you're entering this guided selling flow. And so you don't have access to the whole catalogue. You have access to just these subsets of products given the information you've entered thus far, that's the big difference between guided selling and quick filters. Is one is wide open constraining, the other is guided constraining, so you never see everything all at once. We've actually had a lot of customers tell us that they prefer this mechanism if they want their reps to have a little bit more freedom, because it's much faster, right? Because if you think about having to go through three, five step guided selling flows to get to selecting three products, versus jumping in here and saying, Oh yeah, I want my $10 per unit charge, I'm gonna drop it in, oh, I want my BMC, you know, charge, I'm gonna drop it in, whatever, and then you're there. But if you've got 30,000 items, maybe your reps aren't that quick. So anyway, I selected two products. Can I\n\nSpeaker 2  1:18:07 just ask a question on the new catalogue attributes? Why would? Why would? This is obviously off the old catalogue, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  1:18:19 This is both off of old and new. So we do support dynamic pricing. But the this catalogue is being shown here, given the sinking, that's 360 sinks, sinking of the product catalogue objects in Zora, syncing them to Salesforce, then we take them and expose them here based off the Salesforce objects, so that you could see them and select them. We don't really allow modification and Salesforce of these objects because they're based on what's stored in Zora.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:18:52 What if? What if someone created an attribute for a plan that did not live on the left hand side? Though,\n\nSpeaker 1  1:19:03 if they created an attribute for a plan, there's a very there's a few ways they can create attributes that can be used in CPQ, basically a few objects, right? You can do it off of the billing account, or you can do it off of the Salesforce account. Or you can do it off of the rate plan level itself",

So\n\nSpeaker 2  1:19:29 those three, yeah, go ahead, if I added an attribute in the catalogue, which was, let's say, to be really simple, currents, not, a, let's say I had a region, right? And I created a new region, which was a pack south, right? Sure. How would that region like I know it exists in the catalogue, which means I can filter the catalogue by that region. If I was to directly query the catalogue using the context service, what would, what would happen here? I would build a pack south as a as a region, or is that sinking, or what?\n\nSpeaker 1  1:20:10 So you would build a pack south as a custom field on, I'm assuming either your product object or your product rate plan object, right, depending on what you want. Then every time you go and create a product or product free plan, you would stamp it with the value for that region field on the custom field. Then you would build a custom field called region on the Salesforce version of that object, and it would have the same API name. And then data 360 sync would ensure that it syncs the data to the 360 or to the Zora Salesforce objects. Likewise, we have custom fields that determine what values of custom fields get sent to Zora. And so if you include that field there, you would send the values to be sent on the subscription rate plan, charge or rate plan or product, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  1:20:59 Yeah, so because so it is, effectively, there's a very simple level as a map, but there's a process to surface or map a new attribute exactly one place.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:21:09 It's mapping, yeah, yep, it's mapping because we don't, we don't all speak the same object language,\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:21:16 Yep, yeah. Okay, I got you\n\nSpeaker 1  1:21:19 Yeah, and so I can, you know, I can do filtering here to kind of expose what I want to see based on that. But like when you're talking about actual dynamic pricing, what's interesting in the way we built it is that it doesn't rely on 360 syncing of attributes. Instead, if I had a dynamic pricing based charge, it would call an API the second I hovered over it, right? And it would go and get the pricing information. And so you'd said, if this $10 which is a flat, flat list price, in the catalogue, you would see a little icon that says, this is, you know, dynamic pricing. So pricing ranges. And then when you add it, we would try to say where we look for where you're putting in that attribute, right? Are you putting in the Attribute just on a field, on the charge, or are we getting the attribute from somewhere else through, like, a kind of series of connections? We have a DSL that we use for, like account, you know, source, object derivation, object attribute derivation, and then we would kind of grab the price from the API. Based on that information we're sending the dynamic pricing API Got it, got it understood. Okay, little shopping cart here, just showing like, what we've added. We've added one rate plan for this, BMC, com, 1869 one rate plan for $10 per unit. I'm going to go ahead and add both. I know we're running low on time here, and this is where you basically just see the what you what you're mainly spending your time on in creating a quote.

    "content": "right now a horizontally scrolling table, because I've added extra fields in here. The standard fields are just list price, quantity and discount and effective price. So four fields, no horizontal scrolling. But because I've added more, because there's more things I want to empower my sales reps to do, like I want them to say, Oh, you can actually change the billing period when you subscribe to this rate plan, right? Instead of, we're gonna, instead of US selling it to you or billing you for it monthly, we're gonna bill it annually, things like that. Now a lot of customers don't want that to be automated, or they want only that, or, sorry, they don't want the reps to be able to do that. They want to either automate it, or they want deal desk to be able to do it. So we have that power to be able to control kind of the granularity of, you know, access to these different kind of things. And we've recently added this new modal, which actually says you can take 90% of the fields out of here, and maybe you just have list price, quantity and effective price, cleaning up the table entirely, and then anything extra that you might have that specific users or more advanced sales reps would use, they can define in here. And these are just the fields that the billing system lets us define on a new subscription rate plan, charge at the time of quote creation or the time of order creation, right? And so that's kind of the gist of it. And then the last piece that I'll show you, just in terms of, like, you know, completing demo, I have a on demand preview metrics button enabled. If you turn this off, you basically get preview metrics updating all the time, which means this comes directly from the billing system. This is the invoice items that will be charged on the specific date ranges for this item, given the way it's been constructed. These are the metrics from the billing system. And we've got mappings for where these like where we're pulling these metrics from, and we've done some fancy things, which is a whole nother conversation that we can do around trying to interpret metrics that are billing centric into a quoting or sales centric experience. And we've had to do a lot of a lot of interesting things there, but so if I change this from one to five quantity now I preview my metrics again. This little spinner just means we're calling the preview API. We get the preview back, and now we get new metrics back, right? And that means we also get new metrics at the subscription level. That's very simple, adding a couple things. If I want to add a little bit more complexity, I could say, hey, maybe a month in we're going to increase my quantity again, because I'm, you know, having I need an extra licence, two extra licences in a month. Great. We can do that. We can premeditate it. You can build it in as an order action, and then, hey, maybe again, customers like well, and in six months, I'm actually not going to need that product at all, because we're changing. We're transitioning. Okay, cool, no problem. We'll remove it in six months, we'll say June, July, 1. We're going to just go ahead and remove that product. So now we get metrics for everything. We get metrics for when you added it at five units, one month later, changing it seven units, seven units until July 1, and then you remove it. And t",

Last piece of functionality that I just want to show would be the ramp deal, which I think is one of the best things that we do, and that is where I want to create a 36 month ramp. 36 month term. That's rant annually. So now what we've done is we've created these three tabs here, 123, to show the three different years that would be included for the interval frequency defined for a 36 month term. What this lets me do is it lets me see the timeline of changes that I want to make against a single charge across this three year term, right organised by annual intervals. So let's say I added January 1 my customer tells me that the second year, or I tell them that, hey, we're going to increase your quantity because we're going to expect you to grow with us, and we're premeditating this into our agreement. And then the year three, right? We're growing it again. Now maybe this could be a reverse, you know, price change, right? So, like, you're going, Hey, we're going to decrease the price for you the longer you sign with us. We're going to do a five year deal, and by the end of the fifth year you're going you're having like a 10% discount versus like a 2% in the first so we can do all of those things. They're just actions. And so when we base these actions off of a rent deal, now you get interval metrics for each interval, which is a really cool thing. So a lot of our customers actually use this to create the semblance of what would be an annual contract value or an annual recurring revenue, since zord billing has no native metric for that in the previews, which is a huge pain point for customers. But so they'll do this to create kind of a hey, like, let me at least get the interval metric, which shows me that from Jan one to December 31 this will be an $1,800 term or $1,800 time period. This will be a $2,400 time period, and this will be a $3,000 time period, and that becomes really, really helpful. But the most important thing to realise about ramps is that you don't need a ramp to structure that right ramps just let us visually organise and capture metrics for date periods. But actions can be done anywhere across the timeline. And even when I turned off ramp, which is what I did by turning off that toggle, I still see the three actions that I meditated, right? And you can see that we're grabbing metrics for each segment of time, that that charge is behaving a certain way, right? Giving you a visual visualisation of the way your customer is growing with you, right? And that's what kind of is really powerful about CPUs and rent deals, is it visualises it for you.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:28:29 So that's, that's interesting. We're gonna have to do another demo. I'd like to see a more complex case, because that's, it's really interesting.\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:28:37 But it's, I mean, I, as you're talking, I'm thinking to myself,\n\nSpeaker 2  1:28:43 if next gen CPQ isn't going to be fully baked for a year, and it has one way syncing with CPQ, ie, you could take what you do in next gen and push it into CPQ. You can't push CPQ back out to next gen, which is fine. I think you could tell a joined up story, which is, you know, CPQ is going to be magic quadrant.

We've since moved those user experiences over to our own technology, and what we're looking to do is continue to use our own UIs, our own user experiences, but have it driven by a faster, more flexible Price Limit, packaging model. We also are looking at restructuring the way our subscriptions work. So at the moment, our subscriptions are effectively tied one to one with a product we want in future to move towards.

But we also want to be able to say here is the combination of products we think you should buy. So kind of a the most obvious example we have is the way we sell print. So we sell print as a bundle product. You can only buy a print product with our digital content access, our premium digital content access. Now, in another world, we would model that as either a true bundle, or we would model it as a modular subscription, where you turn on print, you turn on premium, you turn on premium video and things like that. So that's the direction of travel. What we're looking to understand is how we can go from your new product catalogue to having those products and prices visible on our website, and we tend to surface products in three main ways, as SEO landing pages, which you can then configure and purchase. We make a lot of use of red walls and pay walls, where we use in Zephyr. We intercept a request for content, and we need to select the correct product to show. We need to show the right product that's going to convert. And we also make use of banners, which are effectively internal ads. And it's in an ideal world, we would have a platform we could call fast enough at runtime from anywhere in the world that we don't have to build our own cash in layers and proxy in layers. We don't really want to have to say, Yeah, we have this great new price of the product catalogue, but actually we have to export it all to the Canada AWS region because it's too slow to call it a runtime from there. So what we're looking at is whether your products can help us do some of that stuff, and whether they're fast enough to work in the way we want them to work.\n\nSpeaker 1  4:09 Got it. Thank you. Ben, that was a great summary in terms of some of the customised pricing. Well, we'll talk about packaging, but when you think about maybe dynamic packaging is as well as maybe even personalised package pricing. What are some of the attributes or conditions that you take into consideration, other than geography to determine the optimal offer?\n\nSpeaker 3  4:36 Well, we don't, that's the problem. So effectively we have had to instantiate 10,000 permutations of schools to sell, and we can only sell at a price point to a target region for a particular customer segment that matches one of those pre instantiated constructs.

I don't want to inundate you with slides, but I do want to ensure I just summarise some of the key concepts that the Zora team has already taken you through. So I know, obviously I've met with your team. Let me, let me jump in the time machine. When I joined Zorro, now over a year and a half ago, and when I first joined, I met with your team, and we've had a few meetings, and along the way, you've provided very good insights. And so I would say the first thing is, we've incorporated many of the insights that you provided us early on. So I think what you're going to see is the path that we're on again from previous meetings, aligned with where where you're going. And ultimately, our vision is to be, you know, the single solution provider that will support all of your different channels and eliminate the need for Le Mayo some of these other areas. So please keep that confidential, but it's probably pretty obvious where we're moving. So I'll just go ahead introduce a few key concepts and then jump into a demo, and in that we have 15 minutes left at the end where we could go through next Steps and details.

So later this year, we're rolling out we're really enhancing our storefront experiences and subscriber portals. So I know we've taken you through that we could hit that in a future meeting. But really, really the heart of what we're talking about today is when we think about personalization and delivering that right that right price and package really comes from understanding the conditions and the attributes of engagement. So we call this context. It's a new service that supports everything else we do, but it all begins with understanding who is the user, for example, are they a business, education, consumer, residential user? What's their geography? Or if they've already worked interact extensively with the economist, someone like me, then you know, you know how much, which products do I own, and potentially, which new products can you inspire with me or get me to upsell me with? And then, as we look a little bit further down here, of course, be giving you the flexibility, first to package, then to price, then ultimately, to improve conversion with highly relevant discounts and promotions. So all of these elements are either have either been delivered or are going to be delivered across our near term roadmap of February and May. So I'm going to jump all the way to the end, which is, well, what does this look like in the future, and so today, we're going to just briefly introduce a few different concepts. So we will answer all of your pricing questions and packaging. But there's also a new capability that we're introducing, which is our enhanced features and entitlements. So a feature is a product has features, and then the entitlement is really the quantity that you purchase. So again, let's think about the Economist. Maybe you have basic and advanced access. With basic access, the feature might be podcasts, and let's just say podcasts and pages. I know you don't licence this way, but you know here you would say basic would the entitlement might be 10 podcasts and 100 pages, and then advanced is 100 podcasts and unlimited pages. So that's the interplay between what a feature and entitlement is. But the reason I start here is you essentially have sell through many different contexts, you have location, you have industries, you may maybe have monthly recurring revenue or annual recurring revenue, and a myriad of other attributes that are really important to understand for each user, what's important to them. Now, using that the features, then we're actually able, in the future to actually track how many, for example, podcasts or pages or other entitlements that each user is you using, and our vision is by understanding exactly who that user is, what's important to them, we can then enable you to create the perfect product plan and charge and so this really is our North Star. So for example, if I'm a business professional and I'm on the go. So that might be what why one in blue is I'm in California? Why three is I'm business professional, and why five I don't spend a lot of time online? Perhaps, then you might know that z1 which is maybe snippets, podcasts and news summaries are most valuable to me as a result of knowing exactly who I am and what's important to me in the future, you can then propose the optimal product that best suits My needs, and you can essentially bundle together different offerings dynamically, as well as charge them and price them optimally. So I'm going to jump now. That's where we're going. But what have we delivered? So I'm going to jump right in to just a few key concepts. So as I introduced we and now I can go and slide show as I introduced in order to understand context. Hold on. We're still loading. There we go. So in order to personalise pricing and deliver the optimal outcomes. And again, package, price, bundle, etc. We use the Zora context service. And so if we go top down, the first thing we take into consideration is actually how you are structured. So business structure is perhaps, what region are you in? Are you selling directly? Are there other factors if you've got multiple papers, multiple properties, multiple formats, multiple sites, such as perhaps education, government, university, residential, all of those may have different offerings that are available different and different structures. So the first one is how you're how you sell, and then all of the rest of it is all about the customer. Where are they located? What channel did they come in? What catalogue are they browsing? And what's their context, maybe, what do they own? How much have they spent? Etc. And with that, we use that these different attributes. We synthesise these attributes together to determine what product you present, what price do you potentially calculate, and even what experiences do we deliver? Now we'll jump ahead and we'll just introduce the foundation for pricing. Now, with this information, we really have three different types of new pricing capability. The first is just simple attribute based pricing. Think about this a",

    "content": " a lookup. So in this case, let's for a minute. Say, in North America, maybe you have 50 different prices for each state. First and foremost, it's still the exact same product. It's just priced a little bit differently. So for this, for California, maybe the price is annually $100 and for New York, it is 95 that would be attribute based pricing, pre Cal, pre computed, simple lookup. But the other way we could do this is we can compute the pricing, and this would be dynamic pricing. So in this case, what we want to do is take all of these attributes and configure into consideration and then compute the optimal price. So perhaps, and if you look in the bottom right, hopefully you can see that, but perhaps in California, New York, Hawaii and Connecticut, you actually maybe you're providing auto insurance, and those states maybe cost a little bit more to operate in. So if you're in these four states, you're going to do a 5% uplift. Oops, you're going to do a 5% uplift, and then you also, based on the MRR, the monthly recurring revenue, want to give different discounts. So if you're between 25 and 50, you could do a 10% discount, 50 to 75 15% etc. So we, we've given you almost infinite flexibility in the first version. If you can model it in a spreadsheet, we can execute it on your behalf. We have min, max, greater than, less than and other operators all as part of the core platform. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 3  17:18 Ben, how do you want to handle questions as they come up, because I've got Sure. So firstly, is this deterministic? Am I going to get the same result if I pass the same context in twice,\n\nSpeaker 1  17:32 always, and everything is audited all the way through a question\n\nSpeaker 3  17:37 is the is the audit trail of the price attached to the subscription, if the customer converts.\n\nSpeaker 1  17:44 So, yes, it is. So it goes through all of the attributes go through into the back office, or number one, Zephyr gets them. Number two, well, Zephyr now is Zora and number two, it is captured in the audit trail, so you know exactly what price was extended and why, and that is whether they've selected a price and condition online, or they went through our configure price quoting\n\nSpeaker 3  18:11 solution, and is that then considered by your renewal processes? So if that's correct, so if I want to say, I want to continue to honour the discount that the customer got, an acquisition of renewal that will be handled.\n\nSpeaker 1  18:28 There's two ways to set that up. Number one, if those conditions are still true, then the price will be calculated. So if I'm still a university student, I still receive the university discount. However, if I'm no longer a university student, and however you determine that, changing email, maybe the honour system, etc, then it will revert to the next appropriate price.\n\nUnknown Speaker  18:58\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1  19:00 And we also, without getting too deeply into it, I can show you we have a price in waterfall. So also, when you're building these different SKUs, you can see the base, the adjusted price and all of the discounts.\n\nSpeaker 3  19:14 And do the rules have any temple element? Can I say this rule only applies during this period?\n\nSpeaker 1  19:21 Do so rules are associated that there are many ways to do that. So you can do promotion like discounting. Rules can have a term, but generally the product rules, pricing rules are associated. They have an effective date. So you can effective date everything, but they're associated with the skew itself.\n\nSpeaker 3  19:43 So in this, this illustration we have here, I'm assuming that there's kind of like a cascade thing. So you go through the rules and tell you, either tell you match, or when you find one that matches most. The reason I ask is one of our big problems is price rise and being able to kind of future date rules to say, and this rule set only kicks in at this point in time, would be helpful. Even more helpful would be to be able to say, give me a quote for a point in the future, and to have it apply the rules that would be active at that point in the future. Don't expect answers now, but those are the types of things that are useful to us in our price rise conversations.\n\nSpeaker 1  20:25 We do support effective dating. So each product and SKU can have a set of rules that apply to them to for example, support 2025 pricing. Obviously we're right nearing 26 so if I am negotiating a university contract for 2026 it will give me the 2026 pricing when I put that configuration into the system.\n\nSpeaker 3  20:54 Okay, so we can do future data quotes effectively, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1  21:00 Okay, perfect. I don't see where hands are raised. Was there one other?\n\nSpeaker 5  21:08 Yeah, at the moment, we do. So just for context, we obviously using the standard",

    "content": " or a product catalogue, which we do actually have effective dating in, but we just don't use it because the complexity of our platform is that a single rate plan. We don't allow for a different effective dated rate plans anywhere but in Zora. So we, the upstream platforms, don't understand the concept of an effective date for 2025, and 2026 they just notice a rate plan, and that's a rate plan they use. So just trying to work out what the difference is between the dynamic pricing and potential pricing using the new offering compared to the existing product catalogue.\n\nSpeaker 1  21:49 So we use the same concepts of effective dates at a rate plan, and we'll want to probably talk in the following session exactly what the upstream implications are that you're mentioning to ensure it works appropriately in your scenario. And then just the other thing Ben you mentioned on the previous question is, the answer was yes. I didn't want to cut you off, but it looks for the first set of truths. And so as you build it out, it would just say there are three attributes, ABC. So you know, the way you could set it up is true, true, true, true, true, null, true, null, null. And so where ABC could be high monthly spend, high platinum segment, and I don't know some other discount University. If all three of those are true, it's a compound operation, and it'll do discount sequentially in the order that you determine 123, so then the second one could be true, true, null, and so discount, discount, nothing, or discount. So it does, based on the information that you give it, take that into consideration, which is how we synthesise context. So I'll do a few more, just quick slides, and then we'll jump into a demo. So this is the pricing element, and and this is just a very simple example of how we've used this to consolidate from 24 SKUs to two. So this is a hardware solution that's part of a hardware software. And so again, 24 SKUs on the left. And so what we've done is there's a feature, one which is bandwidth, three different tiers. There's an attribute. So this is a customer segment, advanced versus Foundation, and then there's high availability. And you know, you can essentially see how we how we refined. Numerically, it's three times two is 12 times two is 24 now turns into these two basic SKUs. So this would be an example of some of the simple things we solve for.\n\nSpeaker 3  24:10 And when you return, when you return a price to the front end, hours, how do you add an identity to what you've calculated? So obviously there'll be an underlying school, which will be the base of products, and then there'll be a price. So is there effectively a receipt object with an ID? How do we kind of reference back to the data structure that was created for this price?\n\nSpeaker 1  24:37 So the payload includes, so when we go through the order preview and we display the price, and then we check out, the payload includes all of that context. It's all it's time stamped. You can literally, it's a it's a very easily JSON readable API and but it's also in the system, so within order, in every with all these pieces, it passes through, so you know what the price is. So for example, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 3  25:12 So if you consider kind of an optimised route in for a customer, for us, they'll land on our subscription page from Google. They'll configure that product will be shown a price, then we want to check out and honour that price. So how do we say you gave us this price previously over it\n\nSpeaker 1  25:30 that's yeah, so that would be part of the session context. And we then know what price we gave you, what the attributes are, and we check you out at that price, we can get into maybe a little more detail when we get into system design with your team on that if the attributes are true, thi",

    "content": "\n\nSpeaker 3  25:51 is the this is the critical feature for us.\n\nSpeaker 1  25:55 I completely understand same it's also the critical feature for every customer, and as long as the attributes don't change, then we will always return the same price with the audit trail.\n\nSpeaker 3  26:09 Last question before I let you move on, how is Tax? Tax? Then, is tax included in the price objects?\n\nSpeaker 1  26:17 Tax is at the bottom of the waterfall. Unless you want to do a surcharge, we do have surcharge capabilities. So if I pay Bibi cash first credit you after you calculate the actual charge, then you can maybe add in a 3% credit card fee, if you wanted to. So it's all with part of our order of operations for how, how we execute our pricing waterfall.\n\nSpeaker 3  26:46 But I can make a request for a New York based customer and get New York taxes calculated correctly in my initial call, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1  26:57 Well, tax would be, yeah, tax and that that comes at the bottom right using the current system that you use today.\n\nSpeaker 3  27:05 Okay, so we don't have to wait for a longer preview call to get tax information.\n\nSpeaker 1  27:20 So think about, you know, the first thing you do is you have a base and a personalised price. It's just like every other commerce system in the world, right? You have a base price, then you manipulate the base price with adjustments, then you factor in discounts or promotions, and then you have overrides. We have a pricing waterfall that predictably calculates those outcomes, after which, if you want to apply a surcharge, maybe based on payment type and or other DB doing business, fee, and then that becomes the extended price, right? That's that once, that's the extended price. Then from there you calculate tax and other fees. So we, as part of pricing, do not incorporate tax in there, because we don't have all of the other elements calculated tax computation comes in as part of the checkout process. We need to find no final bill to you know, and all of those specific terms at that point based on the extended price with factored and assimilated discount, promotion fees, surcharges, etc. Then we apply the tax code. We could get into it in more detail, but that was that's how we designed the system. Okay, so, features, entitlements, I talked a little bit about that again. The vision here is, as you know, Zephyr already has features, and so think about features as an extension of the Zephyr object being very specific and trackable down to product features. So this is, to us, incredibly important, because that enables to really understand what your customers find as useful, how they're consuming it, and ultimately enabling us to price with greater precision in the future. And then the last one, we talked upfront about bundling. So we have two types of bundles. So let me just say the pricing is currently GA as our context, we're going to be delivering entitlements and hard bundles in the February timeframe, and dynamic bundles later in 2026 so a hard bundle is a pre configured set of individual products, as you've articulated. So maybe product one would be print and product two is digital. And then, of course, you have plans. So maybe plan A and plan z is print for university and digital for university, and maybe charge 123, are additional entitlements that are part of that specific p",

    "content": "an. So we're able to bring those together. And you can merge charges. You can uplift, you uplift charges or discount charges by percent and flat fee. And then you can exclude charges the way it works in the Zora system when you've created a hard bundle, is it essentially becomes a new SKU all of the features, entitlements, attributes are inherited, and then they are presented as a new offer to that user. And then at the back office, you have the ability for revenue management to account for how many bundles Did you sell, but you can then also have the component products and know that I sold, you know, 1000 print subscriptions, etc.\n\nUnknown Speaker  31:13 Then the final piece that I'll jump into the demo is, sorry,\n\nSpeaker 1  31:19 there's a lot going on here, but it's really a configurable or a dynamic bundle. In this case, when you combine product a gold plan with over 100 seats with product B, silver or higher plan, then you're going to dynamically compute a price discount, et cetera. Now, as part of that, we of course, have not only triggering conditions that you put these two together, but you have different business rules. For example, in this case, let's say this is a instead of seats, these are users or readers. So both products have to include over 100 seats. To satisfy that requirement, you can say that we're excluding certain areas, such as Canada and basic plan, and then perhaps with offers and promotions, you're going to say offer stacking not permitted. So these are the types of terms and conditions we would use to constrain and guide a dynamic bundle. And then we'll essentially give you ability, the ability to compute that on the fly. Now, the way we're building this, this is coming in May and or later next year, is all of the same elements we've put in place, for example, hard bundle are now used for, for as a container for this new soft bundle. So it would pass through and it would say bundle. It would have the core products, and then for internal accounting purposes, it will include all of the associated rules that were fight rules and attributes the business user or the custom consumer never sees those rules, but now you at least know internally, why were these products brought together, discounted, and what was the structure of engagement? And so this is something that's unique to Zora in terms of many other platforms. Just they combine the bundle and they push it downstream, we provide that auditability all the way through, and it ensures, upon renewal, that all of the original terms and conditions, if they're still true, you can still honour and extend that same offering. So with that, I'm going to exit out of here and jump into a bundle. I'm sorry, a demo.\n\nUnknown Speaker  33:50\n\nRyan, go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 5  33:53 Sauce asked this at these group last week as well. So when we start to bundle products together, particularly if they've got different types of delivery, fulfilment. So for example, print and digital, just by adding the two products together doesn't necessarily mean you're kind of like charging one price for print and one price for digital, then adding it together and saying, Okay, it's exactly the same apportionment. What happens in the door behind the scenes if you want to bundle a product and ensure that the revenue is split correctly, and also that has a dictation how the tax is calculated as well, because that's one of the challenges, and why we've actually bundled some of our products, or pre bundled some of our products now.\n\nSpeaker 1  34:34 So I apologise I'm not fully tracking. So when based on business conditions, you either have, you either present a hard or a dynamic bundle, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5  34:45 We've got a hard bundle at the moment. So basically, we have a printed digital offering where the revenue apportionment is set higher on print because it costs more to deliver to the customer. Yes, but if we were to sell print separately and digital separately. They're not equal to what the post of a bundle is at the moment, you know, we probably sell them slightly differently. So when you start to bundle products together, it isn't as straightforward as saying, Okay, let's say the current print charge the current digital charge. Add them together, and it's an equal split. For example, it could be that, you know, we start to charge a little bit more on the bundle, or, you know, kind of proportion revenue and tax differently based on those, those combinations. Absolutely, your model works in terms of, like, similar products, you know, but when they're different mediums, like, then tax in particular has a different, different calculation.\n\nSpeaker 1  35:45 Okay, so let me answer part one. So here you you would have it ultimately generates an extended price, but when we push it back up, you'll see Product A here was discounted 30 product B versus 20. So product B would be your print. Similarly, if we come back here and we just say, let's just say it's charge one and four, this could be digital and this could be print the way you treat you know, the markdown on charge for digital, because it's higher margin, you can do a steeper discount here than here, and then when you attribute it back to the original products themselves, you're attributing back. So again, the charges add up into the extended price. But when you for when for back office systems, you know that this was, let's just say, $100.75 was allocated to print, 25% $25 to digital. All of that cascades through and you have that integrity.\n\nSpeaker 5  36:55 Okay, yep, so it deals with revenue from the centre and then tax. Because tax varies. If you bundle products together as well. So you know, if you sold it separately, you've got a certain tax rate. And then, in particular, we've, like, in North America, we have a blended tax rate. If you've got two components of print and digital, where they're sold separately, if we were suddenly separately, they'd have a different tax rate than when you put them together. They have a totally different tax rate.\n\nSpeaker 1  37:22 I will be honest, this is the first time I've heard different tax rates for blended offerings. I know there are different tax rates for standalone offerings. We have not encountered that yet, so perhaps we'll have to work through that with you. As long as you have a blended tax rate table we can then support it, but I've, yeah, that's effectively\n\nSpeaker 5  37:45 what we have. Yes, we have a blended tax rate table for that bundle product when it's bundled together and then everything else has its own standalone digital and print tax table.\n\nSpeaker 1  37:56 Got it? Okay? We can handle that. So maybe jumping in the demo. Jonathan, I don't know if you wanted to jump in, and I know you said you configured your tenant, or I could just start with an empty tenant here and go just show a few things. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 6  38:16 I mean, I have, I think what I could do is I put a couple of, I mean, I want to, I'm just trying to think I've got attributes, and I've got the features in that probably are most relevant to the Economist. So I can have a go, and then we can talk through I was going to build out. I I've got some pre configured attributes. But I tell you what, why don't you keep going, Errol, and if we have to, kind of for focus on something that's more economist related, we can do that at the end. Let me not. Let me not. Let me not break the flow.\n\nSpeaker 1  38:50 Okay, so to The Economist team. Well, if that's okay with you, I'm going to just do a completely cold demo, which will actually hopefully be helpful, because you'll see how we configured the system. So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to add the attribute again, these are conditions, and we're able to synthesise these together for your pricing. So I'm just going to use a simple one, like country, and so obviously that falls in the category of location. Now we can use standard objects, or it supports Zora custom objects, and then finally, that field can come from within Zora, or it can come externally, so it can be fed in through some other system. So obviously, when we're talking about location, that's going to be on the contact bill too. And so now, as you can see, we did country, and we're just going to come in here. And now you can see, because this is an existing field, it's already been pre mapped. And so we're going to make this offer available in Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia. all of the Attribute filters are here. So if you wanted to filter, I don't know this is going to probably clear everything, but you know, whichever products have these attributes are going to be now displayed. So the other element we're going to show you is how to manage the features themselves and add a new feature. So we're going to come in here, we're going to add a new feature called economist podcast, and we're going to say it's metered each and we're going to say the default quantity is five, and then maximum is maybe 100 beyond the 1000. Beyond that. You want to talk to a sales rep. The other thing we'll do, oh no.\n\nUnknown Speaker",

And again, we'll give up to 100 online. Thereafter, you want to talk to a sales rep, and we'll go ahead and save that. Now these could be either metered or they could be unmetered, and those would be things like service support, etc. So now we're going to come in here and we're going to just go ahead and create a new product. And so this is going to be a,\n\nUnknown Speaker  42:03\n\nlet's just say global\n\nSpeaker 1  42:08 dynamic pricing. And so now as we coops didn't want to click there, so now as we come down, first and foremost, to the features, if you recall first you associate features\n\nUnknown Speaker  42:25 to the product. So here,\n\nUnknown Speaker  42:36 something has changed. Oh, add new\n\nUnknown Speaker  42:46\n\nI apologise.\n\nSpeaker 1  42:58 There we go. So we have economist podcasts. And then we're going to add another feature here. We're going to save that. We're going to add the next one, add an existing feature, and we're going to call it economist seats. So this one will make just very simple, and then attributes will come back in here. And again, we're going to go into location\n\nUnknown Speaker  43:29\n\nunder Customer context. And\n\nSpeaker 1  43:46 sorry, here's the location, somewhere down here, just a little bit. We've got economist country. And then again here again, we can see these were the countries that we selected. So within here we're going to select four of these, because it's a European offering, and we're going to exclude Venezuela. Now, as we get into the plans themselves, we're just going to keep it simple. Now, you could put as many attributes. Everything now will cascade hierarchically, and so, of course, I've got, we'll just put in\n\nUnknown Speaker  44:24 today's date, we'll put in an end date\n\nSpeaker 1  44:35 description, And then the category is, this is a base product.\n\nUnknown Speaker  44:49 I think you lost the description there.\n\nUnknown Speaker  44:55 Something's blocking me from saving this.\n\nSpeaker 6  44:58 You have to, you got to save the Economist. Seats, Errol, oh,\n\nUnknown Speaker  45:03 thank you. There we go.\n\nSpeaker 1  45:09 Okay, so now we have saved the core product, and now we're going to add a plan. And so the first thing I'm just going to quickly show you, we're just going to call this basic and as we jump into here again, as we mentioned, the features will automatically cascade, and now you have the ability to quantify those, and I'm just going to jump in here, and the attributes associated that we previously selected are now also showing up. So here we've decided that this is just for the EU so we're going to delete this right here, and now I'm just going to jump into pricing, just very briefly, and then show you essentially how this works. So now we're going to call this dynamic pricing, and you're going to go through, we're going to call this a recurring we're going to call it, just call it flat fee. So we're going to do this as\n\nUnknown Speaker  46:12 per unit. Let's just come in here,\n\nSpeaker 1  46:17 and now we're just going to jump into briefly. Oh, you know what I did? I did make that okay. So now you've got your base price of 100\n\nUnknown Speaker  46:28\n\nand we're\n\nSpeaker 1  46:30 going to go into dynamic pricing. And so here's where you have the ability to incorporate all of your custom pricing. So the first thing we're going to go down here and reintroduce location. So now we have economist country, and as you come in here, you'll see these are all of the available countries. So we're just going to do you could obviously do equals, or you can do what within the range. But let's just say, for simplicity, I didn't enable all of the other sorry.

    "content": "and. We're just going to add an adjustment, and you can simply say, if Poland price equals 95 or you could actually name this as a price underscore discount, and it doesn't have to be underscore, and then you could do 5% and you know, then you just simply do equals P times one minus. And I'm sure I did this as an error\n\nUnknown Speaker  47:48\n\nprice discount.\n\nSpeaker 1  47:58 So without getting into all of the details. You can add and clone as many different rows. You can put in as many different formulas and adjustments as you'd like. And you can again, come back into the system, and you can do you know, these are all different attributes that you can come in that have been previously predefined. So one of the things you will notice as I go through this, and I know these are just all sorts of random attributes, so EU one, eu two, et cetera. But now you can also start to see how we've factored everything in, and you can stack your adjustments and create all of your different pricing rules. So I'm going to pause just in the interest of time. I didn't go through all of the formulas and configuring all of the offerings we can go through and use your prices with Jonathan's demo, but I wanted to pause and make sure we have time for questions.\n\nSpeaker 6  49:11 I think what we could do is we could also maybe Ryan, take some examples of the pricing that you've got, and create some examples of that in the catalogue, and then do a follow up call, where we where we walk through how we've configured some of the you know, how we compress the SKUs, which is obviously one of the key points that Ariel talked about, and then how those are actually built out in the existing product catalogue. I think a real use case would probably bring this to life quite, quite well.\n\nSpeaker 5  49:48 Yeah, the arrow, just for context. So our product catalogue at the moment is really just about renewal prices in Zora, so we're just holding primarily like I mentioned, we do price zone. So that's really kind of like a currency behind a price zone or a region, and then it's just as many products and terms. So if you were not to have different pricing involved, you'd have 800 rate plans because of the 23 price zones, the number of terms and the number of products is just a multiplier of those. Where the complexity with the pricing is, is that we've got, like you've identified customers who are students, they renew on a slightly different price to a standard customer, then you've got legacy customers who are on a different pricing as well. So we ended up with maybe 900 and just under 1000 rate plans. The skew explosion really is on the offer. So the bit you were showing there, where you're giving 10% on one of those, or 20% on one of those, that's where we get to 10,000 but like Jonathan said, good to kind of work through the use case to see that. And obviously you're showing a bit of configuration there. But I guess our ultimate kind of goal was to get something dynamic so that, you know, once we've got those rules in place, then they can be shown to a customer without having to go through kind of that kind of setup to get there.\n\nSpeaker 1  51:04 Yeah, obviously we started with nothing. First of all, once you can, once you configure the system, once it's done, it knows exactly what objects and fields to pull from, internally, externally, once you set up your base product that's done. And then within your plan, you could literally have an 800 if you have 800 different, say, attributes or rules, you could just put that into a very complicated table, or you can build out a more sophisticated row with stacking. I'm not going to tell you which one's the right one, but it's obviously, we're multi conditions fire. You want them all on the same row.\n\nSpeaker 6  51:46 And I think just as a just adjacent to this, we have a an AI team that's built a very useful tool that is a way of ingesting your current catalogue and then compressing that and representing that in some across some bigger concepts. So, you know, how is, how is your current the 10,000 SKUs currently understood, you know, how are they grouped? How are they? How do they? How are they represented in, in kind of a way that is understandable. I'm um, and easily represented across, you know, all of the different permutations that you've got. So that's that would be an interesting process to run to begin with. You know, how do we understand the catalogue as it is today? And then we could then build out some of these use cases. Maybe give us a complex use case, something you know, similar to what you've talked about, Ryan. And let's see if we can then represent that you'll be useful to when we've compressed how we understand the catalogue, it would be useful to maybe take one of the more complex use cases, maybe, I don't know where you have 100 SKUs, and see what number of SKUs we can actually get down to, and I think that would kind of bring this to live, because I suspect that you've got the SKU explosion, but you also have, you know, how do you, how do you understand the catalogue today, and how do we then optimise using some of what Errol's talked About to build a catalogue that has has has an easier way of being understood, but an easier way of them being built out in the long term.\n\nSpeaker 3  53:30 So I know that you want to give us an illustration of how things might look. I'm really keen that we don't embed past compromises in the new model, because I believe that the way we structure things was a way to get around technical process problems that may not exist in the new catalogue. So we are definitely going to take this as an opportunity to go back to first principles. And while it would be good for you to kind of ingest the catalogue for your understanding. There's concepts I just don't want to see replicated in the catalogue.\n\nSpeaker 6  54:05 Yeah, I think, I mean, I think that's part. I've seen some interesting demos where we take more than 10,000 SKUs and kind of compress it down to 10 or 12 big groupings, right? So it's a way of, first of all, understanding what's in the catalogue. Then, then, what I'd love to do is take a complex use case, very similar to how Errol explained the 24 down to two. So, you know, how can we, once we understand what that looks like, what it's meant to do, is there a, is there a good way of composing that, give that to you? And then you may, as you say, Ben, go back and say, Listen, that's got too much of the legacy in it. We want to actually decompose that and rebuild it in this way. But at least what we'd have is a starting point, which would be the compression and a view on what those 100 SKUs or 50 SKUs would look like. What's the minimum number that we could get down to? And then give you that as a working model, and you can take the catalogue and say, you know, decompose that and then recompose it into something completely new.\n\nSpeaker 3  55:09 So that's a great idea. And I think the complexity isn't just in the product structure, it's in the life cycle. So we have complexity around things like free trials, ramp pricing and then the price at renewal. So that would be as interesting to us would be, see how that how that product and its price evolves through its life cycle. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 6  55:32 I mean, I think, just as an aside, what I'd like to do anyway is, I think this will be a useful internal case study for some of the other people on Errol and my team, predo",

    "content": "Speaker 1  0:00 We're doing because we're serving our biggest customers. We're the bread and butter, we're the flagship product. And look, I mean, I don't disagree with that, right? From a revenue standpoint, they make the most money, sure, but at the same time, Zora just integrally, has a problem with understanding how our customers require and use our feature sets, right? So even though billing maybe is the flagship, you talk to BMC and they're like, we can't use Zora at all without CPQ, right? So they sign a $2 million contract with us with Zora. They don't care what's on the item list, right? Allocation to Cbq is 22k yet they will literally say they cannot use or without CPQ. So, you know, there's kind of like a, you know, an element of of the importance of feature sets to how Zora operates for our customers and provides value that is just lost, right? But so when we're when we're working with billing team, right? It's, I can't tell you how many times a month, a quarter a year, I get told about a new feature that billing release in an API, billing release as a, you know, one flag, feature flag for a specific customer use case, never told us about it. So I find out from either GS or from a customer that's like, hey, I want to use this thing. It doesn't exist in CPQ. And look, we have 360 ish, a 380 customers using CPQ, right? A little less than half of our billing customer base. So from an important standpoint, I mean, maybe you can say that we're less, you know, less important than, like, you know, billing serving its primary customer base. But I think that that kind of does the entire zoar ecosystem a disservice in terms of how we can scale in the future, right with what you're talking about, which is omni channel. The concept of omnichannel is something that we've been throwing around for five years. I've been here three Chief Product officers, like four different VPs of billing product, and nothing has changed. We've not gotten closer to omni channel. Omni channel. We've not gotten closer to cross product elaboration, between product catalogue, which is integral for CPQ billing, which is critical for everything, right, if they're the hub, everything else is a spoke. And the way that we're serving any customer through any channel that they want to acquire through, right, acquire business through. So that's like 30,000 foot view. And then I can get deeper. I can give you examples. I can go into features, into, like, the nitty gritty, you know, product complexities that, you know, give us challenges. But I think it all comes down to communication. And I think it really comes down to top down leadership, of saying, Hey, this is what our focus is. Our vision is as a suite, not as order to cash. I hate this. I hate hearing order to cash, because I feel like that's like, well, we're way more than that. Yeah, you know, agree, but that's where we kind of live.\n\nSpeaker 2  2:50 That's that. But that's the, that's my pitch. I mean, I've been saying, you know, acquisition the cash was something that I said in a meeting few months after I joined, because I came in through the acquisition of sub x. So I was the founder of sub cash, and I just, I said, in a in a pitch, I got five minutes at the NPR. I actually was a PNT off site, my first off site, I said this acquisition of cash thing, and no one listened. Now, it's a kind of a, it's one of the main things that the org talks about, because we are in the business of acquisition of cash, right? The the to some to varying degrees. You know, DJ or Boone will disagree on that. Shakir might agree. EMEA will agree a lot, because they are much more B to C and B to B, plg led than no am and all this kind of so there's a lot of there's a lot of different lenses on this, but the thing that seems to be self evident, which aligns exactly with what you're talking about, is that omni channel should not be out of reach. Maybe omni channel was out of reach because the catalogue wasn't fit for purpose, right? So maybe that unlock is is one thing. Maybe omni channel was out of reach because we didn't have a good front end experience, right? We had no wrapper to anything. So we've, we've got the experiences product we're building now. So when you",

So when you take experiences, when you take the new catalogue, when you take this renewed, focused on next, I put vibe quoting to one side, and I'll put cpqx to another side, and just talk about next generation of CPQ when you take those three things together, and then you think about some kind of rules engine that allows us to orchestrate journeys in some way that is omni channel. And in fact, one of the things that I want to try and do with Shakir is I want to show omni channel at sko when is that is second of February. And I think it's a, it's a reach, but, but I think that we have a lot of the the stuff already available. We don't have to do live demos, but we could probably bring something together that's still a, that's a stretch, right? So that, I'm not saying that that's a we're going to do. Over that 100% we may deliver a version. So I'm just getting kicked out by my daughter. You can go and get sorry. Just one second. Okay, yeah, sorry, mate. Just\n\nUnknown Speaker  5:14 like being at the Zora Zora\n\nSpeaker 2  5:16 fish get kicked out, except I have to move a bit faster when my daughter tells me to leave the lounge. So, so, yeah, I think, I mean, I think it's possible, right? I think it's possible, but I think you hit the nail on the head is that I'll do it now, kiddo, sorry, mate, just give me one second. Sorry. I\n\nSpeaker 2  5:51 Oh, okay, all right, yeah. So I think, I mean, I think it is possible. I want to talk a little bit more about next gen. I want to talk a little bit more about next gen.\n\nSpeaker 1  6:04 CPQ, yeah, and real quick, you know, on on showing omni channel. Me like, I don't know exactly what your vision for omni channel is, but I can tell you, in the past, we've built with, you know, support of GS and salisha Consulting, we've built very quick demos around an E commerce portal that can be picked up through a customer like initiated journey, that then you click a button and it says, Help, help. You know, get a get a sales rep to help me, right? And then that actually created a quote in Zora CPQ that sales rep could come in and open and show exactly what the customer selected. And then, you know, the demo was really to Gartner, Magic Quadrant. It was like, you know, sales rep talks, talks to the customer says, Hey, this is what I've got for you. This is kind of what we're thinking. Do you want to proceed with this? And then, you know, sales rep, hit sensor, generate a PDF, and they give it to the customer, right? So, like that part of, like, Omni channel, I mean, we have the capacity to do it. It's not native. Like, there's some building blocks that we have that you can leverage to kind of build that custom flow. But, I mean, this is, and again, this was, like five years ago, where we're, like, we can, without a big stretch, we can build that as a native element, right? So anyways, we can do that. And if that's something that we're told to focus on, it's not like, in eight months, we'll have this kind of, like omni channel experience, at least from from an E commerce portal to CPQ, right? Like interchangeable, like taking a quote and then, you know, pitching into an E commerce portal, likewise, the other way around. So anyways, I liked, I liked that idea that was something that, although landed from a completeness of vision view to mark Louis at the time, he was like, Yeah, I mean, I know that this is custom built, right?

Like, it's not like you don't have a native integration to this stuff. It's kind of like you've plugged the APIs in, which I appreciate, is a possibility, but it's we want to lead with products that are actually like you can purchase and and they work as as they intend. So anyways, like, I mean, I think that it's a really cool idea, and I think that the con, I think that the product catalogue stuff that has been happening is going to be really helpful to all of that and that big picture, but where we keep missing is tying it all back to what Zora does do already really well and has for the last 10 years, and for the customers who have used us for 10 years, is just like critical, right? It's like everyday business flow, create a new subscription, amend an existing subscription. And so a lot of the stuff that, you know, Errol and Tim have been building, although I'm really excited about, kind of constantly trying to remind them, and Manfred as well as and, you know, maybe they'll, if you talk to them about this, they'll say, yeah, like, John's kind of the noisy, you know, kind of thorn in our side, saying, Yeah, well, you need to be able to do this with the billing system. It's like, we need to be able to integrate with the journey customers are on today and how they use the system with the new service, like the new features. And if we don't do that, then sure we can attract net new customers. But like, Okay, I mean, we're What about 1000 customers we have today? That's where I think I get I get lost a lot because we're not thinking about well, if you have an existing subscription, how do you then add a bundle? If you have an existing subscription, how do you then put on a dynamic price product onto that subscription, or change an existing product that's on a subscription to be dynamically priced on renewal. Those things are just things that don't happen today, and the story is you got to replace it, remove it, answer the subscription, add a new and it's like, that's not, that's not the journey our customers want. Like, they don't want to discard 10 years of customer history with a subscription record, because we've had a new feature that actually lets them sell the way they want to.\n\nSpeaker 2  9:53 That's really, so, you know, I like, that's a really, no one's mentioned that to me before, but it makes perfect sense. I think that there. Yeah, so let me. Let me just take that in two parts. Then the first part is so that this is what I love about Zor, is that, depending on who you speak to, Omni channel is a new shiny thing, or it's a thing that's been sat in the corner for a long time, right? Regardless of whether or not it it has ever manifested, the the unlock for this is, first of all, have the story so you articulate it. Well, my story is almost identical, but I kind of put an agent assist journey in the middle, right? How much can the customer do before they need to send it to a service rep, you know, can that? Can that, can they hit a threshold, get an agent to assist them, like a, like a, you know, AI agent, update the self, some kind of self configured view, before they even pass in an email address, before they even need to get to a deal desk or anything like that, you know. So what? There's a sequence there that I think we can refine, but at the root of it is context, right? You've got to be able to pass the customer from one place to other. So we have a context service. I've got Tony Zhang, who's just joined our team, who's thinking about what context should be, and I got nav looking at it, and they're trying to work out, you know, what we kind of we need context. We need a rules engine which is outside, which is not just sitting in catalogue. We need probably some",

We need a rules engine which is outside, which is not just sitting in catalogue. We need probably some kind of orchestration layer that then execute something on the experiences side. So I call this the intersection. We've never made the intersection the roadmap, right? The bit that ties all of these things together is typically lived in a slightly fragmented road set of road maps, which means there's these cross dependencies, and people don't focus on it, and one team doesn't enable the other team. So what I'm doing is I'm taking these concepts out with Satish and saying, What is the layer that needs to enable everything? CPQ, catalogue experiences, and we make that a roadmap item. We make that a focal point for the for the business, and that seems to be landing. And it then gives us some discipline and focus about what this thing is meant to enable, right? There's this other layer which you talk about, which is, well, we just need to be able to do some basic things that that elsewhere. Now, what's really interesting about that is, if you go, Hey, we need to be able to do these basic things. People go, Yeah, we know that. But you know what? Why would I we haven't done we have never done that. So why should we do it? But when you use omni channel as a forcing function and say, Listen, we can't be building, you know, Agent workflows. We can't be building next generation CPQ and leave these dangling items over here, because it just means we're not a platform. It means that we're we're coupled systems that don't quite speak to each other. And that's what I've been doing with Zephyr. Is when I got into Zephyr to see this thing living as this product that sits on the edge of the Zora platform, which creates an endless number of problems when you have a billing customer, just makes absolutely no sense. So I agree with you 100% and I think there's a join those that we think about what you're saying, which is, you know what's true, Omni channel. How do we properly enable it? And then on the other side, how do we make sure that the billing system doesn't have any fragility in it where you just feel like that just doesn't feel like we're what we're building over here\n\nSpeaker 1  13:26 one day. And I think that it's going to take, you know, it's going to take some deep collaboration with and right to say, you know, hey, we understand, I see managers running. We understand that billing has, you know, led the company to where we are today, but if we continue pursuing features and customer requirements with just the billing perspective, then we're going to continue to flounder in the acquisition perspective. And yeah, and you know, looning will be, I've been working with looning very tightly for six years, and you know, he'll constantly, he'll be the first to tell you, like, Yeah, we don't know anything really about quoting like, we don't know like, John tells us what we need, what he needs, from an API perspective. And then, you know, that's always the afterthought, right? Because I get, I find out about it later. And we tried to do better with the whole big feature thing. We tried to do better with, you know, shaker kind of saying, hey, like, you can't have an EA feature unless it's, you know, works across the suite. But we're not, we're not really, like, no one's really, you know, taking that to heart yet so\n\nSpeaker 2  14:43 well, yeah, I mean, I think I do. I do because it just, you know, when I've spent time with Manfred and Errol and nav and Satish, and then when you talk to sue. Here. And then, when you actually talk to Ken, everyone has the same view, you know, every and Pete talks about it all the time. It's the platform, right?

So, if we are truly a platform, then what space are we in? And the bit that is is clear to me is that the field wants to be able to sell anywhere on the sales cycle. They want to be able to drop, you know, we have these boundaries of like, sub 100 million, 100 mil to a billion, large end to complex enterprise. You go to someone in EMEA and talk about complex B to B SARS, they go there. That's fine, but it's only 40% of my business. What I want to do is I want to take 100 million dollar, which is quite big in Europe, 100 million dollar sales, self serve customer, and say to them, Listen, don't bother going with stripe, because you're only going to have to rip it out. Or when you need a CPQ, you're going to have to, you know, you may not need a full blown CPQ. May need something else, some kind of lighter version of CPQ. How do I that? The sales team are pretty simple. They just want to go, Listen, we'll take you on that journey, right? We'll give you, we'll help you scale. We used to do that as an organisation. Apparently, we used to be, you know? We used to, we used to sell to customers who were a lot smaller than the customers we sell to today. So I haven't met anyone that says this is not what we should be doing. But what's interesting to me is like, why? What's been the blocker to doing it, which is just for man, for sakes, what I started off with talking to John about was not, I mean, pitch the strategy a little bit, but I'm really interested in what he's been talking about, which is the cross functional stuff. And he raised this really interesting point about the way billing operates and the way the subscription operates, and how these kind of create disjoints In, in the in, what is, well, not disjoints, but just broken, small, broken pieces of the billing journey, which probably don't support what we think of as being a true best in class, Omni channel product. And I think it's that stuff that probably, that's probably the bit where I'd like to focus. Actually, it'd be really good to try and create a I mean, would you say, John, that that is ranked up in the top three of your thing? You know, if you had a magic wand, top three things you would fix that aren't unlocked for you, or are they just things that frustrate?\n\nSpeaker 1  17:38 You know that? I mean that that is the quintessential unlock to Zora. In my mind, to Zora scaling as a company is, how do the selling motion and the billing motion work hand in hand across any customer journey, any customer segment, right? And, you know, we can go and stand toe to toe with Salesforce, and, you know, RCA, and, you know, insert competitor here, right? Like, I mean, that's the thing, that's the thing that we miss. Like we're so focused on billing being this, like, oh, we can do everything in billing. And Manfred, actually, and I talked about this yesterday, like the complexity that billing can handle is unmatched, right? But it's like, it's like, the, you know, restaurant menu that has 40 pages that they'd serve, you know, everything from seafood to like, you know, Moroccan to like cheeseburgers, like, I don't really want to eat anything off the menu. Like, I'm okay, I'll go, I'll go to the little Italian place that serves only pizza and pasta. Yeah. And so if, if we decided say, hey, look, we're going to do like, these five things. And the five things are like, being able to create, to create a subscription, amend it, renew it, and cancel it, right? And then be able to do usage based and then be able to do bundles. And we did those, those five things, and we did them super well in either billing, from the billing, you know, like billing operations persona, they can create that stuff",

And we did those, those five things, and we did them super well in either billing, from the billing, you know, like billing operations persona, they can create that stuff. They don't, you know, maybe they're a small company or a large company where, like, the deal desk just handles everything, and the deals are much bigger, the volume is much lower, or they're, you know, B to B, or B to any CPQ where, you know, they use source CPQ. And they do those five things over and over again. They do them at scale, right? They do them in large, large volume, but sure, they have the odd case here and there that, like, you know, is so big for them that they don't like, they don't care, their deal desk specialist gets on it, their strategic sales executives on it, and they craft something custom, and that just goes directly to the billing system. It's like, cool, yeah. Like, we don't need to solve for the 1% use cases in CPQ. We just need to solve for, like, the 80, 90% use cases that the majority of the revenue is done in, right? And if we did those five things super, super well. I mean, geez, like, the market opens up for us as a company. And, like, I know very little about Zephyr, to be completely honest, I know very little about. How currently, arrow and, you know, the powers that be in the product organisation want to start building out this kind of context and rules and all of these things. But there's stuff that I've been doing for years, right? Rules is something that Cbq has had since 2016 and so, I mean, it's like we already know how to do this stuff, but we've never had it in a way where you can pick it up in any channel and it's the same stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2  20:27 That's that's the point. So Zephyr, Zephyr knows, Zephyr doesn't have a rules engine. It has a yes, no engine, and the way it's composed, it doesn't have any conditional logic or anything. So, but the the bit that Tony Zhang is looking at is, how do we and also, NAV is kind of thinking about this. My request to them is go away and think about, as I said, these intersection pieces and mantra, and I were in a room with nav and Errol, and there's been some other meetings around this is like a rules engine should be at the intersection. It should be consumed. It should understand all of the different use cases. You know, it can start at point, you know, v1 it can expand. We don't have to build everything all at once, but it just has to be a thing that all teams are consuming. And the utility of that thing in the middle is high for everybody, right? So the fact that CPQ has a rules engine, or Zeph has a rules engine, or catalogue has a rules engine, or whatever that whatever versions of those, there's two problems. You can't have three. You can't have z rules and three Rules Engines. You can, you can't have it because the field. Think about the field, the field doesn't know the field to the field the rules. The rules are rule right? And they get they fall over each other. I have the same issue with with Zephyr and dynamic offers and dynamic pricing in the catalogue, right? You put people don't hear pricing or offer. All they hear is dynamic. And so the message to the field. So there's a lot of layers to this. It's not only at the product level. It's about, how do you combine something so that the field and then the customer can understand what it is that you're selling without you having to caveat or, or, you know, okay, so what here works here, and then we have another thing over here that does that, and then they go, you know, is that the same thing, or is that a different thing? And that makes a lot of, that makes a lot of difference. But I So, I think this is going to flesh out. I've seen two or three documents now which",

And that makes a lot of, that makes a lot of difference. But I So, I think this is going to flesh out. I've seen two or three documents now which be are beginning to form this intersection layer, right? And the way I positioned it to Manfred and to Errol and and the rest of the business is that that there's two things we need to do. One thing we need to do is preserve and protect the individual roadmaps, right? We do not want to dump a bunch of dependencies on on the teams, right? You don't want to go, Okay, we're shifting the cheese now. There's a whole bunch of new stuff you have to think about. It's a bad pattern. But at the same time, we have to build this intersection layer into which the customer and the stakeholder is CPQ, is\n\nUnknown Speaker  22:59 catalogue, is the experiences platform.\n\nSpeaker 2  23:03 But equally, it's not a as a customer, you know, stakeholder is one thing, but as a customer, you know, we know how to build for customers, right? So we have to think about what it is that needs to be consumed. And I suspect it's very similar to what you're talking about with billing. Is that billing doesn't see CPQ as a customer. You get the scraps, you know, you get what's given to you, right? That's not how we treat customers. CPQ is a customer. Is a consumer of what billing the surface area that billing gives you, right? And so solving some of these patterns, you either have to say CPQ is a valuable omni channel component. It's not the tail end of the dog. It's a first class citizen that. And I think that doesn't exist everywhere. I think there's a lot of people that think, well, I've seen decks that put CPQ right the centre of this business with some significant revenue uplift, right? And manfred's done all of that, all of that work. So I don't think that's the problem. I think it's trying to achieve a real vision of omnichannel and deliver it.\n\nSpeaker 1  23:59 So I guess metrics. Metrics is a huge thing in that, in that equation, if you don't, if you're not thinking about it already, it ends up becoming, you know, part of, part of the puzzle, right? Like an integral little kind of cog in the system. Because in this goes to what you were saying. And, I mean, geez, I love that. I love that, hearing that CPQ is a customer, right? It should be an actual, you know, pay attention, attention driven customer that we pay attention to and we like, let we understand the use cases and billing kind of helps, you know, empower those use cases be done in CPQ, because I've told you billing from day one, we're, we're close for customer number zero, yeah, we don't get to use internal API's. We don't get to use, you know, all of the kind of magic of being inside the walled garden, like we have to go and go to the to, literally, the developer reference, and be like, Okay, how does, how do we plug this order request up and say, Ah, this is. This is missing, or I can't even get to the setting, so I don't know that that's enabled. Oh, I can't, you know, I can't see the same data how we're managing the customer's tenant. And this has happened with multi or when I when we integrated. This has happened with prior catalogue innovations. We're extremely, extremely dependent on 360 sync deco to to to our detriment, both from a strategy, product strategy side on platform with the deco product used to actually used to live under CPQ used to live under me. And that got just messed up, taken away, taken the platform and and it's, and you can talk to Alvin about it, right? He's got lots of opinions on this as well. And so we have all of these problems, and a lot of them look a lot of them are going to be solved if we can manage to get the brains of our CPQ tool out outside of Salesforce and back inside of Sora",

But, and that's the thing, we need to focus on, number one before we even can get to like this omni channel vision, where we work really well with billing and other channels, um, but coming back to it, right? If I give the billing team feedback that I can't use the API that they've got published on the documents on the dev, developer reference centre, then it's like, you know, that should be our first cue that that product feature was never ready to even go beta.\n\nSpeaker 2  26:19 It's foundational. I mean, it's exactly right. And manfred's given me a flavour of that with a with some billing requests. Because what I want to do is I want to start. You know, I have a good relationship, really good relationship, with Ken, and I want to just start. And he's a thoughtful guy, and he understands. I want him to win. He wants me to win. So I think we have a place there. But I'm kind of, I've said this all along. I'm really engineering led, so I start with the architecture and the engineering, and then these are the problems, right? These pain points, these create a ripple effect right out into the product. Right? They seem insignificant to some people, but they're really the key parts of how you unlock all of this. So I guess, I mean, listen, we can drink from the Kool Aid. We all agree, right? Which is great. There's some ways to, you know, I'm starting with the product organisation. What I would also say to you, and I said this to Manfred, is, you know, I am not, I do not come from CPQ, right? Man for has been kind enough to spin me up. I'm learning a lot, right? And so what I'm trying to do in the in the way I approach this, is I start with the story, which seems absolutely obvious, right? Omni channel. It's great for the field. It's great for the business. We can win anywhere we have a right to play. There's also a bigger thing, which is the data story. So I come from a data background, so build, we're building knowledge graphs underneath all of this data. And one of the questions I had to Manfred was, you know, if I sell 100 seats, does it matter to you how those 100 seats were used? Right? If the 65 of those seats had 70% usage, and 30 of those seats have 40% usage. Does that matter in CPQ, if it does, we can extend out the data picture, you know, I come from that in get, you know, usage, feature, usage environment, so that we can, we can talk about that and think about whether or not that has a place in your ecosystem. I think the bit. And, you know, we've got the, you know, navs, a massive fan of all of this. So we have some really good architectural minds. Maybe there's some disagreements, maybe there's some history, maybe there's some opinions that don't quite yell, but I think we kind of get into a place where it feels right. What I heard, though, which I was particularly excited about, was Pete made this, I don't know if you're on the call, man, I think you were on the Yeah, you were on the call. You did a great, great pitch. Matt Pete kind of said, listen, just focus on next generation. CPQ Right. Like we got cpqx, we have to do that thing. Five quoting is cool. That's nice. But where our bread and butter is, is next generation. CPQ, right? Do you? Do you have\n\nSpeaker 1  29:04 a one minute definition, or one minute or less of what next generation CPQ is? To you,\n\nSpeaker 2  29:09 to me, it is from what I've understood is a deeper integration with all of the principles that catalogue enables, right?

So, somewhat like, for example, bundles you mentioned that. So, you know, my my lens is generally CPQ as a headless experience that is deeply integrated with the new product catalogue, so bring more flexibility into different environments. That's that's probably an over simplistic view of it. Maybe you could give me a different definition.\n\nSpeaker 1  29:42 Yeah, I mean, I think Manfred and I maybe agree. It's probably been a minute since we've talked about this specific topic. But next gen, over the last year, has been thrown around a lot, thrown around in customer conversations. It's definitely been thrown around with leadership, with Pete, with Shakir, but no one seems to really know. What it is, other than a catchphrase, and then obviously, manfred's got a lot of, you know, features and desires of how to make next gen of like a world class CPQ, which I'm on board with. But I think at its root right? We're calling it next generation CPQ. That means it has to be different than cpqx. Cpqx already can integrate with the catalogue like it doesn't matter how we do it, we can do it. It's not hard, right? Whether it's through data connect, whether it's through the API's that the commerce foundation builds, because we tell them we need these things via API. That's not the problem. What makes it next generation is that the brains of the quoting system, how we construct, what is our magic sauce, which is this super intricate order request that can get census or and create the order with all of the proper validations, guardrails and UX niceties that a sales rep or sales admin might need. So the brains, the processing, the rules right? The context whatever you want to whatever you want to call it, if we can pull that out of Salesforce, that makes it next generation, right? Because we can scale it, we cannot scale it in Salesforce, right? We have customers today that are not very large and are not very complex, that have extreme pain in sending simple, small quotes, partially because of the API's the billing API's scalability, and partially because, mostly because of the Salesforce platform's scalability issues. And we've pulled out all the tricks to get around Salesforce platform limitations. We've done optimizations you saw, you can see in the what's new, what's next that we just delivered, that we've done nine second improvements on being able to save a quote. Why should saving a quote be any slower than sub second? Is a question that I don't understand, right? And that's what our class, what our customers want, because that's what any CPQ out there that isn't tied to the hip to a billing system which has a whole slew of other problems, will tell you that they can do sub second 1000 line quote saves. Yeah, okay, sure. And so we're, we're tied to the hip with billing, which makes us really powerful in some ways, because you don't have this huge integration layer and problem you have to solve where your billing ops are just pissed off and your revenue people are pissed off that they don't make the system work end but where we struggle is that Salesforce has a stranglehold on us. Not only that, their competitor. So they see all of our revenue. We pay them red share. They see all of our customers. They go and knock on all those customers doors and tell them we can do everything better and faster as we're not building on our Salesforce platform anymore. We're building RCA, which is solved the platform issues. And so next gen, aside from features, I really could care less about the features the UX, if you give it a new skin and you say, can you know, dance and sing for you in an animation like whatever, if it just pulls the processing out of Salesforce and lets us do new subscriptions, amend subscriptions, renew subscriptions. We've already won. Next Gen will be a winner.\n\nSpeaker 3  33:09 So, so next year. Sorry, did I have was like, No, that's okay,\n\nSpeaker 4  33:15 a bad cold, so that's why I was late. Yeah.

So it's good to hear everyone's version of next gen, and I think you all guys are right, right. Let me show my version so that we can sing about it. And what do you want me to do? Showed this so I've explained it this way that I have a transactional layer. That's what John is referring to as the back end has rules in there that that's where the performances needs to be improved. So this is, this is bread and butter. If you can't handle the transaction, you have nothing so And sure, we can get better, but right now, we're not saying that we need more transactional things, except we need configurable bundles and advanced approvals, a couple of things to pluck the holes that are obvious and that are preventing us from selling. So you could say there are four or five of those obvious holes that everyone, every salesman Can, can tell you, but for me, it's more it's the analytics. That's you mentioned that by saying, Hey, you have information a back end. Why is it information not available to the salesperson? If it matters to them, right? So does it matter that they have, you know, maybe only one product out of our product portfolio. It could matter, right? Does it matter if they don't pay on time? It could matter. It could matter in all the negotiations. And that's why we need to make that visible to the sales rep. What that exactly is that we can come up with, right? So, and it's for each company different, and then it's the agentic thing. And that's the agentic thing, which just. In, because it's the latest thing, and everyone jumps on it anyway. So we have to get on that bandwagon. And that's so these are the three pillars that I see are defining next gen, right? So, and I don't want to derail you guys, you know, thought track, because this is all you know, aligned with what I'm, what I'm hearing, and what I'm, you know, I think I agree with everything you guys saying. So it's, I think we're a good path.\n\nSpeaker 2  35:26 But it is, I like the, I mean, I like the, there seems to be kind of a layer above this, which it just says, you know, not in Salesforce, the original\n\nSpeaker 4  35:38 driver in the very beginning, when we said, you need next gen, what we did was we need to fix CPQ. That was what, what next gen was supposed to be, and the biggest problem. And I heard that from when I was to the customers performance, performance, performance is the biggest problem.\n\nSpeaker 1  35:55 And to be very clear, though, like getting out of Salesforce doesn't mean we don't have a quoting experience, a UI and a data model in Salesforce. What it means is the brains, the processing, is not in Salesforce. Salesforce owns 70% of the CRM market, right like and I'd say it's a greater percentage of that in our customer base. And so if we don't have a native integration in Salesforce, we're going to fail, period, and in a lot of our customer and this is where we get into this hard, hard, hard question of, how do we migrate customers? How do we take the 360 customers we have, once there is a next gen, and move them into that seamlessly. And maybe it's impossible. I think we've yet to discover really what that means. But if we tell them, you have to one completely eliminate any kind of dependency you have on the data model that we've already built and established in the porting tool for the last 10 years that interprets, parses and presents the data that builds that represents the subscription that you created from your quote. And you have to move to a new data model that lives inside of Zora, or you have to refactor in some way to kind of understand the new object records that live outside of Salesforce. You can't have your Salesforce reports anymore. You can't build your document generation. You can't integrate",

You can't integrate with the CLM the same way, because they're not native Salesforce objects. 90% of those customers will leave, will leave or CPQ, right? So we're not going to displace sales forces play here. And if we're not natively integrated with Salesforce, we're going to have customers walk away and say, Okay, we're going to Salesforce. CPQ, then. So that's, I just want to throw that out there, because I think that that is often lost in that, like getting out of Salesforce means we are an agnostic, you know, CRM, CPQ, we can, you can go to HubSpot, you can go to Microsoft Dynamics, you can go to Salesforce. It doesn't matter, but we're agnostic, but we're outside of it. That's not what it means. It's not what it means to me, at least. And I think that we would be doing ourselves a disservice if we tried to lead forward with that as the mindset.\n\nSpeaker 2  38:06 So what does it mean then? So you talked about the stranglehold, and you talked about the latency. What does, what does this version of maintaining the CPQ footprint in Salesforce, but then being headless CPQ, which can be anywhere, right? Yeah, what does that look like? Is that? Where does that begin? Is that something we're tackling? Is it is other dependencies, or what\n\nSpeaker 1  38:36 I mean, I think that the team is considering it right now, but to be completely honest, I think Satish and nav and Siva have kind of ran off with it on their own. And are, you know, bringing this man for correct me if I'm misspeaking, but they're kind of bringing this under the like, Hey, this is the technical decisions we need to figure out to establish how it's going to work. And so, like, we'll come back to product when we have an outlook, when I when I when I really think that product needs to be involved in saying, well, like, Look, you can't just not have the CPQ quote Salesforce object, right? That like the Zora CPQ quote object, because if you do that, then we don't have an answer to how you integrate today with everything you've built. And so what I think it means, right, is I'm not I'm not an architect, I'm not an engineer, right? But functionally, what I think it means is Zora CPQ as the UI layer, still lives inside of Salesforce, as well as we have our own UI outside of Salesforce for those customers who don't have Salesforce or who have a different CPQ or different CRM, but you still have a quoting tool inside of Salesforce that's native to the Salesforce experience, right? Like you're not going to you're not letting the making your sales rep sign into Zor. You're not making your sales rep sign into a different, you know, iFrame system. The other piece is for the admins and all of the supporting roles. That check a quote right? Your rev ops, your billing ops, your sales ops, all of those folks will go in and they'll look at a quote record. Your developers will go in and they'll take the quote record, and they'll plug it into their CRM, I'm sorry, their their CLM, or they'll plug it into, you know, a you know, Adobe document generation service that's got a, you know, a signature element, and they create contractually binding documents that says to this quote, you've signed to now you've agreed to illegally, right? And so that is all based off of the data model. Then you have like forecasting right opportunities, opportunity products, core objects integral to the Salesforce system, that are informed by the Sora CPQ object structure that we create, right? Because we're native to the Salesforce platform. We create these objects in Salesforce so that stuff has to live and look if it's ended up, if ends up being just cloned object records, versus being kind of like natively created by the managed package, right?

    "content": " know, Adobe document generation service that's got a, you know, a signature element, and they create contractually binding documents that says to this quote, you've signed to now you've agreed to illegally, right? And so that is all based off of the data model. Then you have like forecasting right opportunities, opportunity products, core objects integral to the Salesforce system, that are informed by the Sora CPQ object structure that we create, right? Because we're native to the Salesforce platform. We create these objects in Salesforce so that stuff has to live and look if it's ended up, if ends up being just cloned object records, versus being kind of like natively created by the managed package, right? I don't care, but the data needs to live there, and that data needs to represent the quote, and the quote represents the subscription, right? What actions did you take? What is the timing of events that you've planned for and premeditated, and what metrics impact do those events result in that stuff living at the data level in Salesforce needs to still be there, as well as the UI that the sales rep feels like they're still working inside of Salesforce when they log in to create a new quote, and they do that through their opportunity or through their Salesforce account, everything else beyond that, like the you know, the Rules processing, the product selection, the actual quoting flow, right? You know, selecting the products, adding your terms and conditions, you know, manipulating the effective prices, whatever special things deal rooms, you know, like agentic quote, you know, suggestions, all of that stuff can be powered by Zora and should be powered by Zora because we can scale. Our platform is far more scalable, and we own that scale, but it has to just surface in Salesforce, and then there has to be an object representation of that quote in Salesforce. Yeah, those are the two pieces.\n\nSpeaker 4  42:13 So this is, this may be where John and I not agree on this. So that's very want to give you have a version as well? Yes, I mean, what we want is a seamless experience for sales people. Does this mean we have to have the UI and Salesforce? No, I don't believe so, because what the sales person really recognises is the look and feel. They have no idea where data are stored. Now this is a good idea to store some data in Salesforce. Absolutely so. But I think the question is, which data we are storing, and I think it all spawned off of one question, how does our architects enable us to get without big disruption, without a big bang? You know, here's the new stuff, here's the old stuff. Lose half of our customers. How can we get there? And I think there is, it has to be a technical solution. It cannot be a product manager came up with a grandiose idea how to do that. So now they haven't figured out 100% of it. They have a hunch. They have come up with some ideas. They haven't presented anything. They are still working it. That's one of the reasons why the teacher is also this week in India that they figure out the resources they want to put on all the different things like whiteboarding versus next gen. And they need to talk about this thing, because it will come. So we believe in q3 we have to get to what I call a dual mode, right? So dual mode is you use your old or legacy CPQ, great. You know, you can make holds like you did before. Or you can switch over and say, You know what, I want to try this next gen thing. How does that look different? UI is also bound through an iframe into your Salesforce, so you're not really leaving Salesforce, and that's the most important thing. And you can create your code there, and then you create your code and say, Okay, I want to pull it up in the legacy C. CPQ UI, you can go back that was that's where it becomes kind of fluid, because then we can say, Yeah, knock yourself out for another year, staying on the existing cpqx UI and but we realise that enhancements are not going to happen there anymore. And then you can also, on your new convenience, switch over to next gen. And ideally, you know, if you have an older customer who doesn't use our cpqx UI, which is we call score studio, they have the over and you know, the most more visit based kind of way, they can also switch over, right? So that's the idea. I cannot tell. I mean, that connection has to do all of what we're doing in coach duty. It's obvious, right? We cannot leave half of it behind and say, well, guess what? You can't do any ramps anymore. Well, guess what? We don't have future update on",

But the good news is we have something that works, and it's a blue they can use, right? So that's how I look at it. So I give them the time to tell me how they want to do it, and then I shoot holes into it. I think that's where John and I are a little bit different, because John says, Hey, we need to be now involved with these guys and tell them what to do. I think come back with an approach and technical approach that makes sense to me. Yeah. I mean, I think\n\nSpeaker 2  45:31 I spoke with Satish today, and we spoke about some of these decisions, because the lens of, you know, there was a slightly greater emphasis on five quoting last week. There's a slightly lower emphasis on vibe quoting this week, right?\n\nUnknown Speaker  45:45 So a week a week is a long\n\nUnknown Speaker  45:49 time in Zora, I think\n\nSpeaker 4  45:51 the but I talked to see what gets to my side. You know?\n\nSpeaker 2  45:54 Yeah, ah, yeah. Of course, of course, of course. It goes backwards and forwards, but that's where we have to kind of keep the pendulum swinging between swinging less towards the other direction. But the question I had is, do you ever see a world where Salesforce just turns around one day and says, No more sales quote?\n\nUnknown Speaker  46:14 Studio, no, I don't see why they would. There's no There's no\n\nSpeaker 2  46:19 value prop for them? Okay, all right, so we, there's no differentiation. We, we pay them\n\nSpeaker 1  46:24 a few million a year for for being able to be a managed package on their platform, and the fact that we're managed package, right, we're in the App Exchange, just like 1000s of other applications they have that are all trying to get the same level of status that we have with them as a trusted sales force partner. Yeah, okay, right? And that and that gives customers credibility that their platform works with other systems and makes it easy to integrate, right? That's the kind of thing, and the trust is extremely important. So we have, like Jaguar, they basically, like, we had a Salesforce security review last for a few months due to, like, sales forces fall, actually, and Jaguar was at the cusp of of going live. And like, we can't go live until you guys have re established your security review and our trusted Salesforce partner, like, just like, that's our centre of excellence, you know, requirement around Salesforce management. And, you know,\n\nUnknown Speaker  47:19\n\nyeah, okay. I mean,\n\nSpeaker 2  47:22 I think then the that makes life a lot easier, because you focus in on the debate that we're just having now about the what's the technical solution? That false. I mean, you know, you've presented a spectrum between you and Manfred now, but the principle is the same. There's just degrees of of commitment to one end of the one end of the story compared to the other.\n\nSpeaker 4  47:46 And so I have seen, like, what, what? Why would you build on Salesforce if it's performance wise, so bad, right? But everyone does it in the beginning because it's faster, yeah? Get like, translate. You get the trusted, you know, you're on an extensible platform. F the goodness of the platform and the performance doesn't matter in the beginning, because you're serving small customers. There's three items in the in the cart, not a problem. But then you start growing. And if you look into how companies that have grown on a sales platform, they're all on the, you know, thinking about, damn it. They know these guys, lot of money we pay out to them, and we have shitty performance. How",

And if you look into how companies that have grown on a sales platform, they're all on the, you know, thinking about, damn it. They know these guys, lot of money we pay out to them, and we have shitty performance. How can we get out of it? And then there are different approaches. All of them involve the services. The Headless services are all outside. That's the basic. And then there is, like, Shades of Grey, right? Or maybe we have the UI build on Salesforce, and they're just serviced from the headless services, or it's just all, you know us, and we just branded in a way, so it looks like it's a lightning page, but you know, so that's where then everyone comes later, because they grow, or they have more customers that have larger quotes they have to serve, then you kind of have these thoughts. And we are kind of gotten there because we have big customers like BMC, we have zoom, they're all, you know, performance, performance for unity. I mean, it's like we got hammered on this, on this performance thing. I mean, trying to improve something, we make little improvements. I mean, I think they are little, right? And we spend a lot of time on it. How much time did we spend on it? Already, since half a year, we had this performance thing, and what did we improve? 40% 3030, to 40% in submit and save and submit from 49 seconds, now we're down to 14 seconds. And unity says there was in the Zack, so she was sitting next to me that you know what? We totally appreciate what you guys did, and it's really way faster than it was before, and it's awesome. It's not where we wanted it to be. But now we are at least, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1  49:50 can work with this thing? Well, now we're, we're at, we're par. We're par with Salesforce, CPQ, that you had\n\nUnknown Speaker  49:57 seven right? So seven tickets, but you. Suitcase\n\nSpeaker 1  50:00 seven and 10, and we're at, you know, 11 to 14,\n\nUnknown Speaker  50:05 getting us to seven seconds\n\nSpeaker 1  50:09 not possible without another year work. And even then, Salesforce changes something, and we have to refactor for another six months just to make it keep working. And that's, that's the game Salesforce plays too. So, but look, I mean the last comment on this, I know we're running out of time, and you know we've been talking your head off. Jonathan the the getting the brains off of Salesforce right means we can restructure our agreement with Salesforce, right? Sales. We pay Salesforce rev share based off of customers that have gone production with the Zoro CPQ managed package. And the managed package does everything right. And so we pay, if we sell that managed package for 20 to 40k a year, add on, you know, flat fee. If we change the pricing right, if we say, look the brains of it is now no longer on the Salesforce platform. It's just a very small managed package that creates the data object records and has, you know, either a UI or a skin for the UI that's I framed in. We'll sell you if you want that piece, right? If you want that Salesforce manage package connection piece, super cheap, right? It's a, you know, whatever, $1,000 a year, and that's what we'll pay Salesforce rev share on now and then through, since we're dependent on billing, right? And that's really the billing in the commerce foundation, foundation catalogue that is like the beet meat and potatoes of what Zora does. We bake in if you're going to be a CPQ user now you have a larger spend with Zora, right? That encompasses this extra functionality that we have that's built into the Zora core platform. And then you just add on that little managed package to surface it on in Salesforce. So I can, that's it.\n\nSpeaker 2  51:47 I can get my head around that and that. And the thing is, that all, if you're building this kind of brain, so you talk about outside",

When you could just, you could name five off the top of your 10 off the top of your head. Why would you want to build that thing outside? I mean, having said that, I hear what you say about Salesforce, but that's when Salesforce will will go, Wait a minute. Our revenue share has just gone from this to this. Maybe they're not a trusted partner anymore because they're trying to move the revenue outside of the Salesforce system.\n\nSpeaker 4  52:19 So, yes, but see, they'll definitely do that. There's also process established. And the process is that you have to show to them that you actually not on Salesforce, right? So it's they can't just say, Yeah, before you were in Salesforce. Now you're not, but I don't care. You still pay me, yeah, all your revenue making. That's not what they do. I mean, I know that from my past that you have to go through when you have a new product, you have to demo it to them, you have to prove what you're going to do on their platform. And these are smart people.\n\nSpeaker 1  52:50 Look, they have, they have the entire managed package code. It's not like it's ours, like it's theirs, like it's the managed packages, and it's an app on their platform. They have access to it. They get to see all of it in their security reviews. So for them, for us to be a trusted partner, Salesforce will review the new package that we create in in entire, in its entirety, and then through that, the negotiations are like, negotiation is like, oh, we need to change our rev share agreement, because we no longer do everything that we did. It's just a small, you know, package we we sell, actually, another package. It's a Salesforce. Managed package is called 360 that managed package is, I think it's like 50 objects and very little code. It's just a few objects that basically get data landed in them from the API's that the deco system has. That package is not even subject to rev share at all. And Salesforce has revisited this over 15 years, multiple times, and they're like, Yeah, I mean, we can't justify you paying as rev share because it's literally just a\n\nSpeaker 2  53:52 series of objects. Salesforce is not the risk, I mean, but I agree. Listen, I can see the direction of travel. It makes perfect sense. I'd like to know more from Satish and Siva specifically about what the the brains outside of cells. I'd like to know from you what you think those brains are, right? So it'd be really helpful if you were to send me just a doesn't have to be a technical view, just to kind of a, this is my lens of what the brains compose of because, you know, I can consume that and then take it back, and then translate that back up to Satish and Siva, and try and tease out where that direction is going, because again, we're working at this intersection layer. So this is, again, another abstraction of very important architectural decisions, right? Where do these things sit? Who owns them? Where do we invest our money? What do they orchestrate? What do they empower us to do elsewhere? So that would be useful. The other thing I've got one ask for you is what I'd love to do, because no one's actually shown me this. I'm not going to ask Manfred, because\n\nUnknown Speaker  54:57 we don't have we don't have enough time together. But.\n\nSpeaker 2  55:00 But what would be really good for me and you is, I'd love you to walk me through a quote.

This is not best in class. This is best in class. And then what I can do is I can start to slot in what Manfred has given me, which is, you know, what's our cpqx functional JIRAs, what's our functional requirements from the catalogue? And I can begin to get a real grassroots view of it.\n\nUnknown Speaker  55:46 You tell me, you tell me when? Yeah, probably next week.\n\nSpeaker 2  55:48 Yeah, I'm gonna ping you next. I'll see what your diary is like, and we'll just put some time aside, because next everyone buggers off next week. So it's easier to find some time in the diary. But this has been really extremely helpful, and I feel like what it does is just give a little bit more colour to some of the areas that I can focus on, like billing. You know, how do we play with billing? What are the what are the bigger unlocks for this kind of omnichannel strategy? How do we get engineering to kind of expose a little bit more of their thinking around what you know, how they're going to tackle the brain. So probably Manfred knows a lot more about it than I do, but I'd love to hear it from Satish, so that when I speak to you, to Manfred, and when I speak to you, I can have some understanding of what we're all thinking. And then lastly is, is just understanding at a detailed level where you think that, where we're best in class and where we're not, where your head is at around what you're building this this coming year. But it's been really helpful. I appreciate you spending the time.\n\nUnknown Speaker  56:50\n\nReally cool. Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 1  56:51 I look forward to that invite for you from next week. And yeah, I mean, I can demo at the drop of a hat.\n\nSpeaker 2  56:57 So yeah, I love a good demo. I love a good demo. I could see I sat through bizarrely, I said, I was in a presentation the other day with Ken Houseman, and he was demoing finance operations, and I said to him, I said, there's a room full of people. I said, I just realised they've got a finance operations fetish, because it was absolutely fascinating. I really some of the stuff. I mean, finance is, like, boring to me, but actually, the way Ken presents it, and it goes through all these different demos, like, really good. So I love a good demo. I'm up for that.\n\nSpeaker 1  57:30 Hopefully I'll give you the same kind of feeling with with sales.\n\nSpeaker 2  57:34 That's That's why, yeah, that's it. That's your goal.

That's wrong, yeah. So that was one question. I mentioned pricing moving out into A to O, and then I said, Well, he asked me, Why would that happen? That's what I think believe. I believe pricing and rating are tight, quite tightly coupled in billing. He didn't seem to understand that,\n\nSpeaker 2  0:47 yeah, that's a either he doesn't want to, because I have discussed with him investing, when you define your product or a plan pricing, you should go in there, because the monetization model sit in there. Rating, on the other hand, is usage, multiplication, those kind of things. What?\n\nSpeaker 1  1:01 So, how are they currently tightly bound in in billing today, it's just one thing. So basically, so it's built as a,\n\nSpeaker 2  1:09 yeah, it's just one thing. All the models are loaded in there, and then the algorithms to multiply when the usage comes, when occurring.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:16 And if there's no rating, it just doesn't do that thing.

Want to build a rules and constraint, a rules engine and constraints attacks.\n\nUnknown Speaker  4:07 I don't think so. Anybody asked.\n\nUnknown Speaker  4:12 No. I rather told Errol,\n\nSpeaker 1  4:16 what I'd love to do is, I'd love to say, Listen, here is this middle layer. There's Tony now and Taylor, for example. Three voices. Maybe there's another voice, I don't know. Let's build the bottom of the bun, unencumbered,\n\nUnknown Speaker  4:36\n\nmassive. Then\n\nSpeaker 1  4:39 you kind of reverse engineer, the normal PRD, Frd, TDD, you just go. You just don't write that stuff. You just go and\n\nSpeaker 2  4:47 pitch it, trying to go in a startup mode. And I'm fine with that. That's right. But this is when I started, and this is exactly what I started. And then people came and picked me a lot. We need documentation, because at one stage you will have a ruler engine that you have a pricing engine that downstream will use it. So you are not ready for that. And if you go, this is how Zora works. I'm not saying this is our startup, because it started. You have whiteboarding done, and you're like, This is it, right? And I'll come to where I'm going to go, but I'm just giving you video, so people will come to you will say, I can't help you. So you have to have a documentation. And also,\n\nSpeaker 1  5:28 because which document not prdf, RD, a TDD, PRD, Frd, as well. No, okay, so let's just say my my request is, I want to build the bottom of the bun, right? I want, I want an architectural view of this. I've listened to you, I've listened to Taylor, and I've now listened to Tony, and that's where my trust is. So why can't I just use that\n\nSpeaker 2  5:54 100% we can use that. All I need is because we don't want to misalign between me Harris and I didn't ask them for PRDs what I asked them. Instead, in an Excel sheet in plain English, write the rules, top 100 rules, or top 50 or top three rules that you will configure, because I don't want to be, you know, facing my blind spots after I'm done, I want to make sure that you have just given me the list of rules. I don't need any PRD from there, yeah, I just need a list of rules.\n\nSpeaker 1  6:27 Yeah. Okay, so that's the rules engine. That's all I need, and constraints as well. Okay, and then, but then there's the there's BCS, right? There's the context service, there's a rules and constraints engine, or whatever we call it. And I think Tony made a very good point. Let's not call it a rules engine. Is it's maybe more than that, right? We need to give it. We need to give it another board, another pricing. Let's be back. Yeah, we'll find a word. We'll find a thing, right?\n\nUnknown Speaker  7:07 Is pricing engine, the same as the r",

We need to, we need to socialise that when we're ready, the orchestration and the actions how coupled or decoupled from the rules engine is that\n\nSpeaker 2  7:27 actions are more than the rules. However, an action can be dependent upon a rule, right? So, for example, I won't buy something, but in the flow of purchase, I selected some products. Now as part of the flow, I need to make sure some rules are executed, because I'm executing an action, but it doesn't mean actions cannot be indicated. So you got bunch of actions, but the orchestration is executing the whole flow. Bunch of actions come together. That's orchestration.\n\nSpeaker 1  8:00 So we need an architectural design of this, right? We totally do, basically, if you, if you had, if you wrote the top of piece of, top of the piece of paper, intersection, yeah, everything underneath that is everything that we've talked about over the last week, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  8:17 I totally agree, and that's where I need to be able to go and influence people that I need at least one more fear of\n\nUnknown Speaker  8:27 me.

He's always happy to talk. I can talk to him, yeah, but he said that his involvement now is going to be more on the GS work on boarding with one more.\n\nUnknown Speaker  9:02 With some boy. No, he's on.\n\nSpeaker 1  9:05 He's on cataloguing experiences. I spoke to him just now. I spoke\n\nSpeaker 2  9:10 to Errol this morning, and he told me the same thing. Told me last night, I'm okay if he's there, but\n\nSpeaker 1  9:16 cataloguing experience, whatever. I don't understand that David's going off to do.\n\nSpeaker 1  9:27 Because he explained to me he thought that experiences was an unlock for\n\nUnknown Speaker  9:35\n\nbilling implementation.\n\nSpeaker 2  9:38 Now he's thinking of it from a very different language. Two years ago, what we started was AppSync. Have you seen apps?\n\nUnknown Speaker  9:46 Why did we start? Because when we\n\nSpeaker 2  9:50 like it could have been an unlock. It is not anymore. I'll tell you why, because we need a different approach now. So the reason it could have been an unlock is because when we do any billing implementation, the reason Salesforce beats us, and people have mentioned this in the offset again as well, is people can go in and say, Hey, no, I don't like this.

Don't just give me that is when you can put together your own experience that basically makes a whole lot of difference.\n\nSpeaker 1  10:32 But that's the c1 experience. He was explaining to me that where the cost comes to is in the c2 provisioning. Okay, so like, you've got six APIs. Each API has to get provisions. Each of those is costed a week.\n\nSpeaker 2  10:46 That is not an experience thing, but he said that\n\nSpeaker 1  10:50 that the outcome of those APIs is the front end experience.\n\nSpeaker 2  10:55 I love Taylor because he's a freaking hacker and he'll do something very fast. I love him. This is where he and me will always differ. I want to do things that are done right, the fact that our APIs are antiquated or bad, and people have to string together things the way, one of the ways the experiences solve it, and the way that I agree and another person want to do this is because I want drop in conference. I want something like an AI development kit or an agent development kit, or maybe some people are still conventional. Some implementations are conventional. Want a software development kit which drops that in, that is not experience for me, that is a developer onboarding kit where they say, you develop your own commerce experience, you drop this in. You call this method. How many abs are behind that? You don't care.\n\nSpeaker 1  11:44 He was, he was explaining, if you think about a c2 environment, you know, I want to update my subscription, right? It's like a might. It's like a he represented it to me as if the front end experience, which is the outcome that a segment three is trying to achieve, could typically take six weeks to achieve, where actually we could drop it in a couple of days.\n\nSpeaker 2  12:12 He's right. He's right. But there are two parts to that, right, the part where I call what is experience is the front end visits and\n\nUnknown Speaker  12:19 everything. The c1 experience, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  12:26 So all of that has my abstracted set of methods behind it, yeah. But what if Jonathan comes tomorrow and says, I don't want your elements? Stripe has elements, right? Let's say we call them elements. If you tell me I don't want it, I'll develop my own. Because, let's face it, whatever we deliver today is not going to fit everyone.\n\nSpeaker 1  12:49 Yeah, but that's what we currently do, is we say blank piece of paper. What do you want to develop? Right? So see, that's our default position.\n\nSpeaker 2  12:57 Let's draw a spectrum. Where are we today? We say bunch of APIs, go knock yourself out. They develop everything. Over here are all the experiences, fully customizable, fully design friendly. You can change anything, but you just drop it in coffee. In between, there is a whole spectrum right here in the middle is going to be at least some elements, but I don't want to use others, but I will string my experience together, because I may want to use your payment form, but I won't like your car. What happens then? Then they will still have to make six API calls. That's why I've been saying it again and again. Don't do that aggregation of methods, or, let's say, commerce facing orchestration of my API calls in plasma. Don't put that there. I want it outside so that\n\nUnknown Speaker  13:50 middle",

He's not aware of this orchestrator, because this is that, because he's not aware of orchestrator and actions, what he's aware of is BCS\n\nSpeaker 2  14:08 really me and the other have discussed it, but he believes that, like, like Adam Smith, we can just go down with plasma and We can deliver that\n\nSpeaker 1  14:20 everybody would want to use, that's not gonna that is two years ago. That's not gonna happen because No, I'd need to hear the argument against. I'd need to hear the argument for that. That's nothing.\n\nUnknown Speaker  14:36 Errol definitely does. Doesn't subscribe to that,\n\nSpeaker 2  14:39 not from what I heard. It cannot. It is not\n\nUnknown Speaker  14:42 an overnight thing. Tony would not subscribe to that.\n\nUnknown Speaker  14:44 I doubt, I doubt anybody would.\n\nUnknown Speaker  14:47 So who's your partner? Then a what?\n\nSpeaker 1  14:51 Getting this done? I don't know you well. I'm, yeah, but I can't, I can't help you with the architectural design. Is it Tony? I think is a is an animal, good partner. But again,\n\nSpeaker 2  15:04 the way I work with Tony, I've been working with him for two years. I have to give him a problem. If I explain him a lot, then he kinds of goes into a POC random mode, where you have to keep on nudging him a lot. We did\n\nSpeaker 1  15:19 mediation humans. Maybe it's just human beings, right? I like to\n\nSpeaker 2  15:24 think that give Tony one big problem. Probably there is no one better than him to solve that big problem. Whatever big problem you focus him on, on experiences, he'll figure it out, for sure. But my again, this is just my thinking. I'm not saying we can't put everything on to me. I would think you would have two or three engineering stores, three, three engineering sports. One is only, and only dedicated in making pricing and packaging manager or commerce graph, like we spoke about yesterday, that does merchandising, that does pricing, engine that does complicated rules, that does constraints. It's a big ass piece that's algorithmically complicated and has to scale because I will add six products on the car, and I want you to return like this, right? So that is one big piece. Then comes context management. The guys doing this should not need that the context management is thinking about, how do I sit across the board, and how do I serve the customers in their in the client side, so that you do not have to lift a finger to create a context? I give you, again, a kit that or a method that you drop in there and I read your Dom. Dom reading is not that easy. Are you buying something? To me through the configuration that hydrates the context. And not only that, every single change in the interaction continues to enrich the context as well. So that is a piece that is to be sitting across the board as well, but right up over here, rules here, context is there, and tomorrow, you might want to think of context across the door, right? So we have to have that lens and context,\n\nUnknown Speaker  17:07 and also behavioural data as well,\n\nSpeaker 2  17:08 and behavioural data. So that's very much of before even, like we go down to even experiences is dependent upon, right? So that's second piece, the third piece, literally, this is what Arrow. Arrow called me today. And I explained in the same thing, this is my thought process. If I had the team and I had to divide it, this is what I would do. The third team is now.\n\nSpeaker 1  17:34 So you got you talking about teams that don't exist, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  17:38 I'm talking about scores. Let's say may not be teams. Could be one team. You create sports, right? So there is a governance body underneath. There are PMS. And PMS are tied to the squads. One team can be tied to multiple squads. Those squads are dead focused on these things, and we have one massive meeting every two weeks where everyone comes together and does a demo, right? Third Squad is experiences, because CPQ and commerce, they will have shared experiences as well.\n\nUnknown Speaker  18:08 Yeah, the experiences squad is done. That's good, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  18:11 And then the fourth one is, you still have to keep the catalog",

CPQ has had 18 people, and I haven't seen velocity. 18 is a freaking massive team I had for six months. I'll do a startup and leave good 18 people,\n\nSpeaker 1  18:53 yeah, I've done it with six. There you go. 18 people, yeah. But so what I need to do is I need I'm seeing Satish next week.\n\nUnknown Speaker  19:02 Absolutely what I what I mean, listen,\n\nSpeaker 1  19:08 Errol's like, incensed by the speed of experiences teeth, like, I feel like I had to walk him off a bridge today. He's this insane. So I've got to sort that out.\n\nSpeaker 2  19:22 I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I think at your level, we should think about more squads. There is a next gen CT squad, right? And there is a legacy CPQ score, you have a six squad team, actually, yeah, this\n\nSpeaker 1  19:35 is what I want to speak to Satish about, right? So what, what I need to do is I need to look at all of the engineering capacity and then the objectives of what we want to achieve. And if you actually ask Errol man, you know, he's doing two. I mean, there's two big revenue, potential revenue streams. Three, actually potential revenue streams next year. One is, you actually just polishing up CPQ,\n\nUnknown Speaker  20:08 make it better, and then,\n\nSpeaker 1  20:11 well, there's actually, there's some nuances next, next generation of CPQ and vibe quoting are gonna fall over each other. I spoke to Manfred, they're gonna fall over each other. There's a dysfunctionality to the way vibe quoting has been set up. It doesn't make any sense. I'm not gonna say too much about John. I gave a scenario to Manfred. I said every single person in the CPQ team today that's not in vibe quoting wakes up and wishes that vibe quoting will fail. That's their first thought in the morning, because they're like, we're doing this. We're doing this in next generation of CPQ. We've got an AI layer. And so there's a fundamental, there's a dysfunctional anyway. It's another story, but there's so he's got that over there. Then you've got the Errol team, and then Errol's team, and then you've got experiences. So what I'd want to do is I want to look at the total engineering pool, and I want to say, what is the size of the team that should be able to deliver these capabilities? Right? The other bit, by the way, is that the way JIRA is set up, is there are, is that there are capabilities that overlap each other. There's not a single capability under which there are stories that are related cataloguing to there is these multiple not even the I don't even need the initiative. I just need one\n\nSpeaker 2  21:41 capability. That's because individuals put it together.\n\nSpeaker 1  21:44 Yeah, so that's got to change. So there's a funk, there's a there's a structural nature to\n\nUnknown Speaker  21:49 JIRA. He got another challenge as well.\n\nUnknown Speaker  21:54 The white coding team is Sivas team,\n\nSpeaker 2  21:58 Legacy CPQ. Is legacy CPQ, who is next gen CPQ? Team. I thought next in CPQ would be done by silver, but then now I am. When I spoke to silver, he said, team wants to be focused only on two projects.\n\nSpeaker 1  22:12 Team, Team what? That's the operative word only team, team project has no understanding of the downstream impact of that decision. Doesn't care. Of course, he doesn't care.\n\nSpeaker 2  22:23 So apparently Siva said, Me and Satish. Siva and Satish met me, and Dean said, do not distract him. Let him do this. Yeah. So I said, Okay, are you doing this? Then he said, Yeah, I will be. I'm not working in December to March, but I'm coming out in January, and I'm going to research with the sales people. Like this is another problem, which is teams causing that. I will be talking you will be talking to sales people. Manfred is talking to salespeople.\n\nSpeaker 1  22:49 You frustrated? Yeah, honestly, yes, it's bullshit. It's a sandbox, a toy box for the CEO.\n\nSpeaker 2  22:57 If that is the case, then silver should not have been moved under Satish.

What do you think is the trust level between engineering and the product\n\nSpeaker 1  24:16 management right now? What do I think is the trust? Trust I don't think anyone has a shared view of anything, so I think trust is probably love. Trust is very low because people don't have a shared vision.\n\nSpeaker 2  24:30 Yeah, or they're tripping over each other without naming names. I know that there is some feeling that Satish is not the person who knows the space\n\nSpeaker 1  24:43 I'm learning what I let, what I let happen was I let Jimmy run his thing, I let Satish run his thing, and I wanted to see where it ended up, and what it's ended up is actually Jimmy, Jimmy. Jimmy seems to have a really good, functional understanding of everything. He has very bad style, right? He's derogatory and, you know, almost the border of temperamental, yes, that's it. But now, condescending, condescending, yeah, but if he's good, then maybe you could give him a bit of attitude. Satish is very amiable and nice, but, but he actually lost the battle on what the TFs wanted, the Toyota Financial Services. There was a debate around what, what we could do with the plasma, what\n\nSpeaker 2  25:36 we could I was invited to that, and I was like, Guys, I have a view, and I don't want to triple, I don't want to jump on salish's tail, on this, on his toes, because then that will\n\nSpeaker 1  25:49 not be he'll not take it kindly. He will be like, Okay, I let them run each other. I just wanted to see who won. Jimmy won. So I'm coming back to my original point. So I've said, I said to\n\nUnknown Speaker  26:01 so I'll be transparent with you. I said to\n\nUnknown Speaker  26:06 Errol, as I said on Tuesday,\n\nSpeaker 1  26:09 like I have a high degree of trust for you, like you're my guy. Like, if I want to validate something, I'm coming to you. Errol said there's another layer, which is the politics between move and Christine and Satish and tan boy and like, there's this whole and I said this, I'm not actually interested in that. Like, I have to be the point. I have to now be the place that people take that out, right? So if I go, that's the direction of travel, then Moo, has to come to me and say, you can't have that direction of travel. And then the next step up is Pete. Yeah, that's fine, yeah, I'm okay with that.\n\nSpeaker 2  27:00 Oh, whatever you know the dynamics. You see that as well. I don't have to hide anything. There was a battle between me, which is where I got caught in, yeah, but I do not see tan boy engaged in that anyway. That's why I'm engaged with you directly. He would come to me and he'd say, why are you doing this? That's me to manage.\n\nSpeaker 1  27:22 I have told yet. He came to me separately. Yeah, he said, I have to engage with him. And if I, you know, I've got to accept that he's, you know, if I want to engage with him, I have to accept his arrogance.

So if he's in terms like, if he's kind of just feeling a little bit better, that's also really cool.\n\nSpeaker 2  29:05 He called me this morning as well. We had like, I feel he sometimes is open to me. He's super concerned about engineering. Yeah, he believes that 70% of whatever we did on in this week was something you wanted to do. I said, You know what, almost 95% of what you wanted to do was what I wanted to do. So it's not that I want to do it. It's about how it is sold. Now there is a larger audience that is behind it. And secondly, you would have never gotten CPQ. You would have never gotten pricing mark my word Shaki didn't trust you for that. So because you have an element that engineering keeps on complaining about you, that's that's the reality. Through your good intention, you have created that aura. But Jonathan is coming in fresh, and he has a seller's mindset. People are following him. So I would say, do that and let's deliver what we have.\n\nSpeaker 1  30:04 It's just enablement. It's just, it's a it's a level of coordination, it's just a different skill set. That's all it is. It's just a layer.\n\nUnknown Speaker  30:19 We take it lightly. But\n\nSpeaker 2  30:23 I used to think that product leaders have to be in the beads and doing all those things as well. But I believe there have to be people who are literally at that layer like you are, and are avoiding to go extremely into daily nitty gritty.\n\nSpeaker 1  30:38 There's that. But I do. I am very engineering. Later I do, no, I saw like, I want to be in the room with Tony and you. I want to internalise I, I was, yeah, I need to do that. That is very important.\n\nSpeaker 2  30:53 But writing 60 page every day, walking people through sometimes you don't even need to do that. Yeah, you don't like, listen,\n\nSpeaker 1  31:00 you'll know, you'll know when I need, when I want to be there. But\n\nUnknown Speaker  31:08 just coming back to practicality, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1  31:12 I all of a sudden, like, there was a little bit of a joke, but there wasn't a joke all of a sudden, you everyone's best friend, right? Yeah, and there's a little bit of foam up. I go, NABS my guy. And everyone goes, Wait a minute, actually NABS my guy, right? So that's good, yeah. But why want to know what the next step is in your mind to crystallise this? Because if we're February, and this is still not that the momentum will blow you up, this is one shot we got one shot.\n\nSpeaker 1  31:52 Sit with Satish next week. Like, do I need? Do I need to make space for Tony and you to be in a room? Is it Tony you and Taylor? Is it Tony you and Christina? Who else is it? I'm not super sure\n\nUnknown Speaker  32:03 about Taylor's space right now. I do not know\n\nSpeaker 2  32:07 that Tony and I definitely can work together. My biggest constraint is going to be, this is a job that needs to be 100% this is what you're doing daily. There are many topics, and there's a lot of detail on this. I'll show you the text Tony.\n\nUnknown Speaker  32:29 What did he say? I'll show you. You\n\nSpeaker 2  32:39 up? Yeah, I'm sure so he's a buyer, right? He Tony. Every time Tony has been wandering, he is not a right person for doing something like conventional re transformation of the code? No, no. He's a guy for doing algorithmically elegant. He's brilliant, and that's all\n\nSpeaker 1  33:00 he cares. And I love my CTO is just like",

Me driving what we should do. Tan was sponsoring me and Tony to go and do it.\n\nSpeaker 1  33:24 So you have working you have working history, right? Plus he knows he's got tenure, you've got tenure. So you're both on the same level. You know he you both bring different skills. You know what his strengths are and weaknesses, which is good, so is it then a two man team where you just not to build it, just to design it.\n\nSpeaker 2  33:53 Again, comes back to, what are we designing? So for rules and everything, I think he's the best guy, really.\n\nSpeaker 1  33:58 Well, let me start up. Sorry to interrupt you. Let me just start what? There's a diagram, yeah, like Mine's the the Lego Land diagram, like the simple, over simplified stakeholder thing, the intersection structure. There's a there's a diagram that says, This is what's in my head. Like that feels to me. The first step is, there's a diagram that you and Tony agree on, which is how these systems interact. How do they actually live together?\n\nUnknown Speaker  34:29 I think that is true. You might be\n\nSpeaker 2  34:33 It's okay. I can manage. So we'll have to bring in Errol, because he would want to be in there. Yeah, and right now, as my conversation this morning, he wants Jimmy to be on all those conversations.\n\nSpeaker 1  34:43 I'm happy, listen. I've learned. I'm happy with Jimmy. Jimmy comes from it, from experiences. Experiences is the sharp end of a lot of this stuff, right? How it, how it, how it composes, that it's also good for Jimmy to have that, that that knowledge. So I'm not, I don't mind the village, but I do.\n\nSpeaker 2  35:03 But the it slows you down, huh? It slows you down big time, yeah,\n\nUnknown Speaker  35:07 but, well, that there's, it depends.\n\nSpeaker 1  35:11 I accept that. Okay? I accept that. So you have two choices, and the choice is yours. You just go and do it quietly, and you come back and I say, I've asked nav to do this quietly. And you come back and say, Guys, this is my lens, okay? And then we get to that meeting. Now, that's my preference. So why don't we just do that? Why don't you just go around and say, Listen, tell Errol. I'm gonna tell Manfred. I want nav to give me a picture of what this is in his head. We are all gonna then get in another room and we are going to debate and challenge and bring in the heads right in a very contained way. We'll socialise the document for the one pager first, and then nav can talk us through it now. Then, at least you've captured everything. What I'm not saying then is it then becomes a village. At least you've captured everything. Yeah, the\n\nSpeaker 2  36:14 I think that is right. Let's do that that is anything needed, so that everyone has a bigger picture. And then we can double click each of the modules. Because starting point keep going into that how it is being built. Yeah, starting point, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  36:27 We've already said the intersection. So if you say this is the intersection, in my head, I think\n\nUnknown Speaker  36:33 that's that's an obvious lady,\n\nUnknown Speaker  36:37\n\nthen you're unencumbered. You've\n\nSpeaker 1  36:40 probably got a lot of this anyway, a lot of thinking around this. You can still cherry pick a conversation with Tony. Yeah, you just go run your method. So what would we what we would say is that by the end of the year, or by the end of January, or what?\n\nSpeaker 2  36:57 No, I think early January should be fine. Okay, yea",

Yes,\n\nUnknown Speaker  37:05\n\nearly January.\n\nSpeaker 1  37:06 I'll tell I'll chat with Errol, and I'll say what I want is, for me, is I just want a starting point. Let's do it. And I think the starting point is filtered through now's lens, right? That's number one. He's gonna seek some stakeholder input, maybe, of course, of course, just to formulate that. But he's gonna suck, rather than us pushing a pull rather than push, yeah, and then that's good, then you, then you're good. Then I what I can do is\n\nUnknown Speaker  37:34 the tactical delivery that anyway, these guys have to push\n\nSpeaker 2  37:39 during that period so that they have tactical road map or commitments that they will have to continue doing.\n\nSpeaker 1  37:44 Yeah, that's that's insulated. I need to go to Satish and say, Let's lay out the org. Now this is what I'm doing with NAV. He's running his own motion to give me this document will sit, will will so if you think about there's the story at the top, at the bottom, there's this other document. So at the very minimum, you've got a story in a document that tells you, that tells you that this is the functional design of the story. Okay, so that's the burger framework, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  38:18 One person you're missing in that business, who is the next gen CPQ person, yeah, I can use Tony from one side, but I need to bring the next gen CPQ person, whoever that is along.\n\nSpeaker 1  38:29 And, yeah, the problem is John, as the PM, is not technical. He's not so I need his\n\nUnknown Speaker  38:34 team's guy right now, if I just,\n\nSpeaker 1  38:37 yeah, you want to do that, let me find out who that person is. Let me find out who that person is. Does the name? Does the name come to mind or not?\n\nSpeaker 2  38:47 The entire Nixon CPU architecture design, I did it myself. I'm happy to do that still, but I don't want to make engineering feel that is the case. Yeah, you\n\nSpeaker 1  38:57 need a champion. You need someone you can go to say, Listen, this is what I'm doing.\n\nSpeaker 2  39:02 Yeah, I can still use silver. Actually, I can still use silver. Why not?\n\nSpeaker 1  39:08 You're not, yeah, you're not doing any you're not saying, don't go off road map. You're saying, I need some information,\n\nSpeaker 2  39:14 not even information. I'm just gonna give a download. Similarly, I'm gonna give a download with Tony the way, the way I run. I'll do the first car. I have them throw darts at it. Yeah, they ask questions, and that then evolves from there on. It explores sometimes. But that is good. I'm okay with that.\n\nSpeaker 1  39:30 I think you've got to have, you've got to capture. There was, we've had a lot of debates around what is a rules First of all, I don't want to call it a rules engine, because I sent this to to Shakir. He said, we've got drills. Why do we need rules? And I hadn't had the conversation with Taylor and basically Jules just to look up.\n\nUnknown Speaker  39:50 No, it's a little bit more. So I'll tell you what.\n\nSpeaker 1  39:52 Okay, well, this is true. This what I love. I get one answer from one foot. So he said to me, the rules\n\nSpeaker 2  39:57 Taylor's just like, really, like, going all the way. Drool is actually very powerful, right? But where do you use it? Rules has two major things. Why we use because we only were factoring in the algorithms that match the mathematical libraries.\n\nUnknown Speaker  40:13 Drool has a very powerful support for\n\nSpeaker 2  40:16 all of that, right? So, yes, it has a decision table, which, in a simplest word, you can call a lookup, but it's not just a lookup. There's more complexity built up just that. We use it as a lookup in a different thing, it has dynamic binding as well, which I can do, but at the same time, I can also build a decision graph as well, where the nodes can be reversed based on some context. Right at the end, I can execute mathematics as well. All that is in truth. The problem with rules, however, is I have to pre compile everything.\n\nSpeaker 1  40:47 Yeah, that's what he said. If you change something the hot, you have to recompile it, and then and then it has to go recompile, and then be distributed across all the tenants.\n\nSpeaker 2  40:56 Okay, not a big problem, b",

    "content": "cause what I can do, I can recompile, recompilation doesn't take a long Yeah, okay, even if it takes 30 seconds, I'm okay, yeah? Because in a given tenant, I'm not gonna have more than what, 200 rules. The biggest tenants we have right now have like 100 CPQ rules, let's say 500 rules, 1000 rules, still, within 30 seconds you can compile. The only thing that we do not have coded right now is a hot reload. Basically, you have everything done running, and I just circulated and it's get reloaded. We didn't code it because it's early version. So the if I do hot reload, rules is enough for pricing. Now comes the complexity. The complexity is we have started using the same rule engine for negotiated pricing. What is negotiated pricing? You got a million customers out of million, let's say 100 customers have negotiated prices. We are using the same rate tables to store all that as well. And if I do that, every single customer has a version change, I'm freaking compiling everything. So we didn't build the architecture is not built in a way that every single customer can have an isolated table so the hot reload is contained. It's an architecture problem, not a rules problem.\n\nUnknown Speaker  42:11 So would you, are you saying, then\n\nSpeaker 1  42:16 that drools could be the substrate to all of this or that question.\n\nSpeaker 2  42:21 This is why I gave that diagram to Errol, that you got a single abstraction optimizer, or whatever arrow calls it, optimizer, behind that rule engine and constraints. But you can have five implementations. Rules could be just my pricing implementation. I have product matching, inclusion, exclusion, going through constraints. I can have go rules into that. I can have dmn for something else. I need to map the right technology for the right thing,\n\nSpeaker 1  42:51 yeah, okay, so, and also, you have to think about, what's the future going to be a year from now? Does it? You know, rules probably are not going to be needed anymore, yeah, yeah. So that's exactly right. So that's the end, like, that's the question you have to ask, is, if I build this, do I end up building a legacy approach that I can't unwind? Right?\n\nSpeaker 2  43:13 So let's not forget the grammar for all of this is always same. If this then and this, or this then do this. That is do this could be a mathematical calculation and expression or a notification action, whatever that expression\n\nSpeaker 1  43:31 is, that thing is, that's a very important thing, right? Because there is a natural resistance in this business. So there's a reaction to we build features for customers, which results in we have this thing. Why would we build something else that's like, this internalised? We got rules, yeah, yeah. So that's that thing, right? Well, we don't build for customers. We're not building features. We're building for value. Now that's a new motion, but it's like, we don't want to build something new. Here's the default. So immediately shakes response is, we have tools. Why would we not build on that? So what I need is in order to take a technical view up,\n\nSpeaker 2  44:15 we need a reasoning framework at dog that where are we? Why should we be doing\n\nSpeaker 1  44:20 this value and use value as the motivator? Okay, if we want to deliver value, true value, which has it has a vision of what the future value will be we have to build in this way draw. This is the precise limitation of drawers. Yes, it does all of this stuff, but it cannot do this stuff. Now we then we have a choice. Do we use drools and or do we just not use drills?\n\nSpeaker 2  44:49 Just say that I don't care about that. Performance can suck. Let's use them.\n\nSpeaker 1  44:54 I get it. That's that's part of the decision tree. Your decision tree, okay?\n\nUnknown Speaker  45:02 It's a very there's a lot of factors,\n\nSpeaker 2  45:06 and it's very obvious. It's a big undertaking. That's why I keep on saying that. I fear my bank is gonna come in the way, because the way it needs to be done is 100% focus, no distraction. Just do, do, do, do, do.\n\nSpeaker 1  45:22 Well, my argument is gonna be, do you want commerce foundation or not? Right? So let's that's a problem. Let's stack rank that\n\nSpeaker 2  45:31 they will say, yes, yeah. But then if I go to PP, is gonna be like, Dude, you ar",

That's where I struggle.\n\nSpeaker 1  45:46 Well, you've got a stack rank, then you've got to either motivate them, or you've got to say, Listen, I think the, I think the most important thing for me to do is this, right? And honestly, if my stuff comes number five, so I have to live with that. I mean, genuinely, you see, what I believe is, I believe individuals have got to use their own stack ranking. It's like Errol. Errol, subtly changed, as I said that the other day, I will take what you give me if you say, Jonathan, you don't owe me anything. You've got a stack rank to what you think the value of the business is. That's it. I'll take what you give me.\n\nSpeaker 2  46:21 That's right, right. Let's let me work through this, because I do believe mid January or something, we can have all this done because Tony is there. I'll see how much time I get from Siva for that. If I have to fly and sit with SIVA early January, I'll probably do that. So be it 10 days, and then it is doable. And to be honest, if you ask what I would think this is p1\n\nUnknown Speaker  46:52 because it covers a whole lot.\n\nSpeaker 1  46:54 You have to motivate for that. Independent of me, this\n\nSpeaker 2  46:59 is where Pete says, these things show me some gains, so that I'm motivated, right? So it's like, it's a chicken and egg somewhere. You got to think, yeah, so some of\n\nSpeaker 1  47:09 you have to put it well, why don't you, why don't you do it like this, right? You you do your internal stack ranking and say, Listen, you're p1 or p2 or whatever it is you do that. And I'm super cool with whatever you tell me, because I will recalibrate my delivery, and I will change my subtle emphasis. I mean, listen, I was emphasis on Zephyr six months ago, because now I'm not so emphasised on Zephyrs, because Zephyr it suits me to not emphasise that, because I have other things to do. So I will take what you give me as an input, I'll change my internal calibration, and then that my output will change, but I'm not going to pressurise you to give me one thing. You tell me what?\n\nSpeaker 2  47:58 Next week I'm meeting Pete. I think this is a good input to that discussion. Look, this is my map. What do you think I should be focused on?\n\nSpeaker 1  48:07 Yeah, and he's got to recalibrate his thing as well. Like, because what Pete wants is new SKUs, right? So if you want a new SKU there's two places to look well, one place at the moment, is experiences. So experiences can be a very simplified thing. Just give me my account, right? Maybe commerce foundation is the skew of the future. So does it? When does he want that skew? When does he want omni channel? So again, he has to calibrate. See, I think what we tend to do is we tend to say, I want this. You have to give me this. No, that's wrong. I say, Here's my business case to you. Here's my thesis. Let me I've laid it out in front of you. You take that. You stack rank because you've got other hypotheses and other thesis and other business cases I don't know about that's it. Let Pete stack rank you, and then I'll take what you give me.\n\nSpeaker 2  49:11 I respect that. That's that's really the way to approach. That allows me as well to have an open conversation. Because here's Mike, my problem is not a problem. My reality is my immediate boss doesn't care. He would be like so I have to make a new boss, which is Pete, and I have to go and tell him, this is where it is. So let's work with and he has been supportive, if I'm telling\n\nUnknown Speaker  49:36 the truth, he has been very supportive. He has been supportive of\n\nUnknown Speaker  49:40\n\ncommerce as well, and\n\nSpeaker 2  49:44 not for you to share with anyone. He also indicated to me that you need to be more involved, because I don't think the solution.\n\nSpeaker 1  49:52 I'd say that's true.

So let's, let's, that's what we do. That's the next big thing. The LLM Council\n\nUnknown Speaker  50:42 actually that that is coming. We do, but\n\nUnknown Speaker  50:44 honestly, we would do better if we,\n\nSpeaker 1  50:50 if we, if we, each of us synthesise what we want into a markdown like everything that you could possibly think of. Or if we were each our own frontier models and the and we and our Markdown file was, this is what I want, just synthesise the best course of action. All we're trying to do is, in a very clunky, human way, create the LLM Council, right? But we're the problem is, we're all biassed. We have emotions\n\nUnknown Speaker  51:27 and personal goals and all that kind of stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2  51:30 People used to say this, right? You should have something that you wake up for every morning. And actually what you're saying relates to that, that if I have my Markdown file and it's prioritised, that what is my pathway, what is like stack ranking and all that, and I take out your emotions, you will do much better, because there's one goal and you would actually achieve it, or you will drop it and never come back because you have resolved it. But we actually run five to 10 squares in parallels not completed. Keep on just riddling in it, and that is actually\n\nSpeaker 1  52:01 and we wake up and we feel different. We want something different. And Harold gets frustrated with Satish and mu, and he wants to escalate. And then that creates a subtle friction and a defensiveness in move, and all these emotions overlap these kind of critical paths that we should just be following. So I don't know, but I think I love the idea of I can now think when I wake my internal model is I've given I've given you nav a set of I've translated to you an objective and a set of decisions. You take that and do it, yeah? You run with that, and then we're cool. Now I'd have to think about anything till the beginning of January. Perfect.\n\nSpeaker 2  52:51 Yeah, cool. Good Good job. Yeah, but are you leaving tomorrow?\n\nSpeaker 1  52:55 Tomorrow, night, tomorrow, four o'clock tomorrow. So I'm gonna 4pm or 4pm Yeah? So I'm gonna do some work tonight and then do some work. Yeah, I gotta, you know, it's like that backlog that built up over the last\n\nSpeaker 2  53:12 week this week was good. I was good. I think many, many pending alignment items, which everyone sees it now, I could see Manfred being very comfortable, like, Oh my god. Finally, we are getting there. Errol is still sensitive. But I think once you start seeing\n\nSpeaker 1  53:30 things, Manfred is super chill, though, right? He's like, he's like, come on, yeah, it's like, he's not a friction guy. I think his biggest problem is that team, team took a chunk out of him, you know, he's like, they have a bit of friction together, but he's a chill guy, you know, he's an experienced guy as well, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  53:53 Yeah, he's a good guy. I mean, opposite personalities, Errol and my friend, totally opposite. Errol is like, every time he talks to him, hey, there's my rise, my 87 stack rank. That that thing I can I mean, I told everyone. If you say that once more, yeah, I'll tell you before you join. I'll tell you, I'll speak that sentence for you. I'm starting to now memorise every single little word.\n\nSpeaker 1  54:21 Yeah, there's a pattern there. There is a definite pass it down. It's a defensive pattern. It's an insulation pattern,\n\nSpeaker 2  54:27 because the other things and so do I as well. Sometimes that the brand equity has taken ahead, but then he hasn't rationalised that this is over. Bad equity can take a hit because the dynamics. And secondly, you got to you got to learn from that as well. I learned as well. I learned few things. I learned that I should not have listened to convoy. My biggest learning convoy is a hobbyist does something, and he made me want to do this as well. Second problem, I was given a team random people didn't even know commerce caravan. I had to educate for first six months. I should have walked away, but I didn't walk away. So I didn't do a good job at creating a narrative, which is what I realised this time, like that narra",

But if I see arrow has so deep knowledge that his biases of that knowledge creep in that others feel disconnected or threatened by those heavy\n\nSpeaker 1  55:27 they don't understand the language exactly, just at the simple level, right? They don't understand. Manfred does not understand sometimes what Errol is saying, and Manfred is a smart guy,\n\nUnknown Speaker  55:41\n\nmarketing doesn't understand. No\n\nSpeaker 1  55:44 one understands. I have to take seriously. I mean, first of all, I know where the brain is. Errol is a brain. I have to synthesise. Sometimes have to synthesise. I have to Google what he's telling me. Like, what does that actually mean? What's that word mean? Right? Because I want to be very precise about what's the translation of that word in his mind to mine. So there's that. But the other thing is, what you have, what you've been very, very careful with rice. Rice is used as a quantitative framework, but it's 100% qualitative, because you are doing it, you are interpreting what the customer says to you correct, and you are ranking and scoring it. Yes, there's a quantitative people use it as a quantitative framework, but it's a qualitative measure, huge internal bias. What am I hearing to,\n\nSpeaker 2  56:33 let's say, somebody who doesn't different, they'll be different, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1  56:38 That's the problem, right? To be very, very careful with rice, because you use it as a weapon, but it's, it's a fundamentally not that. It's a simpler representation of your interpretation of the customer.\n\nSpeaker 2  56:52 So you are creating a market, but that market eventually may not even exist. And secondly, what rice doesn't give me, it tells me the current pain point of what they are facing. We're not asking, would you have this in six months from now? Would it rank as one of the top three priorities to trigger a transformation? The biggest challenge in our space is going to be, hey, you have this already. Let me transform your experience. People are going to be like, Nope, it works for me.\n\nSpeaker 1  57:21 So the other thing is, why acquisition the cash work so well? Because I told the customers over and over again. I told the sales people over and over again, that's where you want to be no rise framework, correct? This is like, that's where you should be, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  57:39 You know, if you had a catalogue associate with it, if\n\nSpeaker 1  57:43 you had a catalogue like that, you have to have the technical foundation. That's the but the bottom of the bun again, if you had a catalogue like that, imagine what you could do with it. Yeah. Anyway. So, yeah, I'm super excited about it. I would not get it done without you, but you, you, I think there is many a slip between cup and lip, right? There's a lot of places this will fall down. But I think if we are very methodical about it and build the story and the proof points, we'll be all right.\n\nSpeaker 2  58:22 We got to approach it in arms over others. I like I was not ready for you to say this that okay, let's do what should be the end state first, because that's sometimes I've tried that that is not what flies at Zora, at Zora workplace, is this is what we need to deliver. Let's do that. And time and again I tried that. You can ask Mo. Mo doesn't like me at all for that, because I would say, Hang on, customer. Ask, sure. But customer is not aware that we are developing the product or not. Let's do what instead would be. Then, if you want me to say I'm only going to do this little flavour of it, which is 6% of the whole thing, I would say that because we have an agreement and we have a vision that is shared, we don't do that over here. And if you want to bring in that, that's why my brain has tuned to that. That's not enough.\n\nSpeaker 1  59:10 But you know, what's interesting about that is it's very hard for peers, engineering peers, to do that to each other, like because what will happen is the language will always come back to the engin",

My bet is on first principles, right? That's my bet. Build properly, understand the minds of the people I'm working with, and then champion those. My mistake will be, if we get it wrong, if it's wrong, I'm happy with that. Honestly, I got nothing to lose. But if you don't bet on people having vision, and I've got to be honest with you, if you if you come in, if you take look at it through my lens, you Errol. Manfred, Tony Taylor, whatever, Jimmy, these are good bets to have. I mean, like to be a very oversimplified about it. I know when to make I know I'm good at betting on people. It's just a synthesis of great ideas, right? Yeah, I'm just the storyteller, that's it. But I would do, I do. I'm sorry. I'm being a bit over reductive about myself. I do want the engineering bit.

That's the unlock, the elegance,\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:01:22 the well done architecture actually unlocks\n\nSpeaker 2  1:01:27 you can build very fast, and now where we are, we need to focus on that even more. Let me\n\nSpeaker 1  1:01:32 ask you a question, why have you stuck around? Though? Like, it's a yes, like it's always a bit of a frustrating place, like you're\n\nSpeaker 2  1:01:38 multiple things. Okay, so I joined in Australia. You joined in Australia? Yeah. I joined his world. Back in Australia, I was in Australia, really?\n\nSpeaker 1  1:01:47 Yeah. Was that when Mark ganyer was there, or was he come laughter?\n\nSpeaker 2  1:01:50 So I joined in 2018 Mark Garnet came in 2022\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:01:56\n\nwas Andrew Robertson. Andrew\n\nSpeaker 2  1:01:58 came after me. Andrew came just when I was leaving. Okay, so all these solution architects that they have over there were hired by me. I even interviewed Charles as my boss for my boss. So I rebuilt that team. Before Pete, prior to Pete, we had three, yeah, he was the next dynamics guy. So we meet in the zone, because everybody was like, you need this guy over there, because he understands Zora very well, and the zone is almost doesn't give it. Give a note for churn, and they said, We will not talk to anybody at Zohra. You guys are over here. So Sri goes in. I go flying from Australia. I reach like 4pm three is still in the air. He said, We will meet at 10pm when I left in my hotel on the outskirts near April. So we worked until next 4:30am to build a slide when I did not know anything about the zone. That was my journey with Sri, and she was like, What the hell\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:03:11 are you? Are you in GS, I wasn't. I did\n\nSpeaker 2  1:03:15 majority of the implementation that happened between 2018 actually, majority of the customers that were private, because in 23 I've touched all of those in Australia.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:03:26 All.

It's a very subtle colour to how you think about how you design\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:04:41 outside, in versus inside, changes it completely.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:04:45 There was a time actually, both Gazan and zoom sent an email to Sri and then to be we don't want anyone here only now can travel. Actually, this happened in his own CTO Sandeep. He said, Do you know why you are here? I didn't even know 50 people, all the zone directors, plus. And he said, You are the only vendor here. In fact, I got a job offer from him I take line,\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:05:10 which probably I should not have.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:05:15 Yeah, see sliding doors within Zora. I've been doing different jobs. Then the catalogue came along, then catalogue came along. I had a hard time with tamo and with Zora politics, getting things done, from it\n\nSpeaker 1  1:05:28 being aligned to Tamworth. I'm very experienced, and tamo is a hard character.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:05:36 He can be a hard character. He can evaluate me in different circumstances. But when you come in the way of delivery and say, This is how we do it, we don't do anything else. Backward city, copy code,\n\nSpeaker 1  1:05:47 it is hard. No, it's hard because he's an unpredictable very is a bit of a narcissist. It's a super brain, but it's very even for experience, even for someone with tenure, it's a very experienced it takes a it takes a very, very, very experienced human being to navigate town. It's hard.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:06:10 We can't navigate anywhere. I do not know. But anyway, long story short is I've had like, four jobs, three or four jobs at Zora in my head that kept me interested, entrusted into Zora.\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:06:24 And honestly, I have had say as well.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:06:27 But last this year hasn't been that great. Quite honestly, this year, on personal level, I've been\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:06:34 doing a lot of family\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:06:36 things because family, you lost\n\nSpeaker 2  1:06:38 your dad. So my mind has been there. And then I decided to tell tanvo, don't bug me. End up going stop. Then when CPQ came along, I was like, this is job number five. I'm gonna do it. So that's when me and Dean had a strike, which is happening, which is okay, I don't mind this, that's corporate, but I feel Zora could have been something. But I also feel Zora comes in their own way, like we keep on saying we have plenty of data. I'm the only one who's vocal and say that data is not what we think it is. We don't freaking even capture behaviours. We capture the action and the outcome. You can predict something, but not everything, but still, let's get it out there.

But this interests me a lot.\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:08:30 And I guess my question to you is, it\n\nSpeaker 1  1:08:37 feels like if we delivered this over the next year? I mean, I always think about, do, I mean, I'll learn something whether I stay in two years or not, is irrelevant. But it feels like, if we delivered this thing over a year, that's something you can write about, like, like, just like, that's something you can go, when you go, when you finally do resign, and you go, Well, you know, I did, you know that that commerce, Omni channel commerce that's always got, that's mine. And let me tell you the story about how we got there. Story was a bit of a shit pop I've been through, you know, and one day we all got together and we said, this is what we're going to build. That's my story. That's how I think about this. It's irrelevant if I'm here in two years time or not. Yeah, I have to stay for two years. Two years is an infinite lifetime in this business. But if I walked away from this saying, you know, that caught that, that Zora thing, like, why Zora one? Why Zora got 5x you know, because we'll probably sell to work day, right? Awful one. That's what happened. That's where it's all getting peeled up Todd's probably the most important person in this company, because it's all about financial engineering. But workday are gonna on its merits. Look at are we future forward, or did we just build for today? And they're not stupid. If they don't want to buy a current day product, they want to build a product. So I think workday wants omni channel.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:10:13 I would think so, because they are all middle to back only. Yeah, that to middle to back on the other end of the story. They're not middle to back on this side of story any bigger than this. That's a lot of data they get. So they're going to look at the data, because that's more valuable than the process in one to two years. And you're right. That's actually what kept me going as well that I have heard slowly, when I started catalogue project, when I sold it to Pete Moo came to me and said, not gonna work. We have tried it four times failed. Okay. I went to Christine and said, You guys had tried it. Tell me, what were the pitfalls that's not gonna work. We tried it. Okay? I went to moves, most trusted engineer, Beijing. I said, Please, I've been told you were on that I can share the repo. Not easy, not doable. It'll die. You can't even test it out. That, to me, felt like\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:11:09 I got to do it so absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:11:13 But I set some ridiculous goals. This was my first project with thumbnail. I had never worked with thunder. I did not know how to navigate. I always kept on telling him whenever I'm telling myself when I was frustrated, he won't want me to fail. He gave me some counter intuitive directions, and he would bring people in directly, my team in, and would say, don't listen\n\nSpeaker 1  1:11:37 to NAV. Do this. Yeah, it's Mo.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:11:40 So I was like, there were days that I was like, I'm resigning today.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:11:45 Yeah, that's why I said it's complex. You can't work like that. You it's very,\n\nSpeaker 2  1:11:51 very I did resign November 2023 really, but you came back? Yeah, I was convinced by Team tango, and a team called me. He was like, why? What do you not have here? What else do you want? You're doing one of the biggest possible project. And then he told me this, the only problem you have is a team vote. You do not know how to navigate.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:12:16 No one knows how to navigate, unless you're tam boys, direct boss. I asked tam boy, I'm very interested in my little tam Moy, because tam Moy tries to one wants to dominate me by telling me the only reason I'm here is because he vows to me like, I'm like, I'm beholden to him.

You're calling architecture. Zora doesn't is not a place where architecture is a thing. This is before our conversation, when I was having an honest moment with Peter as well, because billing says I have to enjoy good video. I don't have time for architecture the foundation. Yeah, I'm gonna do it. Okay? So what do I do? I can I don't have authority. I have influence, right? So influencing without authority in Zora doesn't work. You can form partnerships now you come with a different, new lens. That's why I think we can work together. Yeah, we can. But imagine that if I kept on influencing the existing breed of people.

I mean, there's a few people in my career I've gone that's just the guy I want to work with, or the or the person I want to work with so listen, we're going to get to we're going to get to do that under the cover of no risk, right? That's great. We can all sleep at night, because starting going to a startup, or starting a startup is a hard fly, but I think we let's be really methodical about it. So what we've agreed is your vision is transposed onto a piece of paper. First. That's not that's job to be done number one. And then in a year's time, we'll either we'll be sitting here and we'll go, well done. You're off. We've either done it or not done it.

It's what I would it's some type of rule framework that can understand the layout of the catalogue, so it knows about the charges, and it can run, you know, it has to be able to go in run within five less than 500 milliseconds. So if it was another service, then that becomes problematic, ",

I think the concept is that the same rules engine should live for CPQ is the same thing, yeah, that's the intersection I'm talking about. Is that you build it once correct, and it understands\n\nSpeaker 1  3:51 well, what feeds into that blue box, right? There is a set of attributes. Maybe it says, Okay, I coming from\n\nSpeaker 3  3:57 one question for these things, is that if you, if you see things right, you select only the select, or only the filter. You know, my mean, if only the filter, filter, filter, yeah, if we only filter, only filter and combine meet some conditions or filters, filter odd, resort to this new stuff, configurable things. These do not need\n\nSpeaker 1  4:33 room, yes, so it could be filters, but we're, we're,\n\nSpeaker 3  4:37 yeah, we just use, elect search, search\n\nUnknown Speaker  4:41 for what's the limitation? Well, so, but\n\nSpeaker 3  4:43 here's what these things is, that they do not do actions.\n\nSpeaker 1  4:47 So let's, let's call so filtering basically just says, I'm going to compose it. But what I think that blue box really needs to be, it needs to be both a filtering thing that says, based off these conditions, please pull these things together, but also apply maybe validation, or do something that says, hey, like that blue box, right? Starts expanding that then says, Well, maybe it pulls in extra discounts that need to be applied if you're feels like that's a limiting factor at some point, if you do filters exactly\n\nUnknown Speaker  5:19 only that is a limiting factor. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3  5:22 Filter another thing, yeah, subset.\n\nUnknown Speaker  5:25 This is an action.

You just looking up,\n\nSpeaker 3  5:42 yeah, look up things, and the filters, you can define different layers or the few. So there's a\n\nSpeaker 2  5:48 simpler concept, which is, I just want to filter. But what you're saying, there's a second part to this, which is, I then want to create some kind of compliance or validation, or whatever. I want\n\nSpeaker 1  6:00 to filter the charges. I want to say that the quantities all have to be the same. So that charge object right in that rule system, I could see where, okay, please combine these charges. Also make sure that the quantities are going to be equal across them, X, Y and Z. There. There becomes these other things on top of it. Now, if you're the problem, you can't your filtering system and your rules need to be together. Otherwise, if you're jumping from one to another, yeah, you would get, you would\n\nSpeaker 2  6:29 get, this is what? This is a complete blue box. It has all of those.\n\nSpeaker 1  6:33 It has to be able to do filtering validation. Yeah. Well, that's, that's a\n\nSpeaker 3  6:36 proper your validation is something, okay. I mean that the filter is just C suite, right from a big one to small one. Rules is input small and wrong, some determined or decisions, logic and got some actions different,\n\nSpeaker 1  6:55 but rules could have access to there's no reason that says the rule, yeah, right, because the data here, right, being catalogue, right?

Okay, we leverage these things to filter some things, or to a small one and a small one. Then we split these rules, but common rules we can relate\n\nSpeaker 1  8:42 to filters you're treating Well, when I say charges, I'm only talking about catalogue charges. I'm not talking about charges related to subscriptions.\n\nSpeaker 3  8:54 I understand you mean so for that the product, the plane, not subscription to the plane. I know that correct.\n\nSpeaker 1  9:01 So you said, Okay, if you had to stick this in memory, right? Okay, well, that would be, let's call it just charges or product charges times tenants, right? This number is not something that goes like this. It is not, you know, charges times tenants,\n\nSpeaker 3  9:20 yeah, for your case, maybe it's just a small case for you kids. I mean that, therefore, for many scenarios, we need to get our source for some subscriptions information, because you have to know what is the subscription term and how they use some things.\n\nSpeaker 2  9:41 Are we talking about? At least you have two different concepts.\n\nSpeaker 1  9:44 So there's two different concepts. So you got the scale there, which is called charges times tenants, right? There's this other one that says charges times tenants, times subscribers, right? Yeah. This is a much bigger number, yeah. Now I think there's a difference here of how we partition this your rules system, right? If I'm coming in that says I'm not, if you don't have the concept or your context doesn't include customers, right? Having this in memory is only this, and it's very fast, right? Now, let's say Tony says, hey, I want to get a custom quote for Tony, right? Well, now this thing needs to go and fetch for Tony's specific thing. I think it's fine for this thing to have to say fetch if it's Tony, because Tony can be slow, right? But if it's a rule system that's governing in you know, not the individual you know, you you get what I'm saying, like they're this, this thing, if it stores memory of here and selective addition, right, sure Tony has to pay a penalty when he gets his custom quote. But that doesn't affect everyone else.\n\nSpeaker 3  10:58 I mean, I mean that. I mean why you copy these things to system memory, understand the facts are related things. My points here when we define some conditions, right? Conditions, there are many kinds of the conditions, yeah. One popular one is just the filters, yep. If they have some futures, why we need to copy the data to here. Why not? We just Okay, put this filters logic to here, let this guy to filters based on this stuff, and get this more data.

So my point here is that we can split this scenario and characters, different kind of conditions and actions to different things, and we can merge together with Thor US data structure as a basic thing, and merge together as our solution.\n\nSpeaker 2  12:16 So yeah, what I'm understanding here, just zooming out a little bit, is these are also that this type of discussion is also related to what you said before, which is whether or not our existing Z rules, it can't so existing\n\nUnknown Speaker  12:35 rules can't even do is just a look up, sir. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2  12:37 Okay, well then so what I kind of what I feel is that\n\nSpeaker 1  12:41 what we're talking about here, current rules cannot support, and even if it did, the problem is that yeah, the dynamic, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2  12:51 where in the mark, if we built this rules engine, which seems to be a solid business use case for what We want to do with commerce Foundation.

I wanted to walk you through commerce foundation, but I will set up another meeting for to pitch to I mean, I can share, I can show you the pitch, actually, that was recorded. I just want you to see it, because I want you to look at it and go, you saw it, right? The Commerce foundation. Story, Tony, yeah. So I want you to go, Yeah, I agree with that, or I don't agree with some of that, or that. Let me pick it apart. Well, it's general direction is right, so we have to be aligned on it. But so what we have to what we're effectively doing, is making a business case for why we would invest the dollar in a rule, in a new rules engine. And it seems to be absolutely evident to me that there's a very solid business case for it.\n\nSpeaker 3  13:44 Can I either one comments, yeah, why we coordinate?\n\nSpeaker 2  13:48 Don't know, because that's what, that's what tell me using, tell me what, what it is, what it\n\nUnknown Speaker  13:53 is, it is a lookup.\n\nUnknown Speaker  13:54 No wait, no, what is?

It is, but I\n\nSpeaker 2  14:19 don't think it can be at the plan level. I think we have to abstract the name out to like a subscription engine, or a plan engine, or something engine, or AI or an agent ready, orchestrator, or whatever we want to give it.

So would, what would you do? Would you get in a room, get into a level of detail that I don't understand, or it's not relevant for me to know, and I see where you're going with all of this. I understand the concepts, but there's probably another layer beneath this, which is an engineering validation, an architectural validation, where you go, okay, really, what are we going to do in this thing? You give it a name, you write a one page business case that says Y, Z, rules. Or, you know, the lookup service is nowhere close to doing this. This then becomes what we call this intersection item, which is a engine, or whatever we give it, whatever name we give it, that it's foundational to delivery of commerce, right, of true omni channel commerce that then becomes a focal point for the business, and that's what we have to do, right? And then when I go to Shakir and I say, we're not built, we're not going to use zeros, I have enough. I have a one pager, which I can internalise, and I can make the business case to him to move to Satish and to Pete and unblock us from doing this, because this seems like this is where the value lies in commerce. Foundation is a thing that tell me something, does this get us to parity with the market, or does this get us to better than the market like? Is this market table stakes? Or is this market leading this approach?\n\nSpeaker 3  16:08 Since approach, I think there are several companies are using some things as I know right for I know he has some mitigation for the competitors.

That's the only other colour, I would say, is we go, okay, well, that's what we want to build today. Is there a better way to build it for a year from now? Does this become legacy, or does it? Does it become extensible? That's the only other lens that I would add to but\n\nSpeaker 1  17:52 me and Aaron will target. They're still deterministic, right? So it's not like, Okay, well, with today, you're getting a lot of, let's call it stuff that's using, you know, vector stores to find nearest neighbours and things like that. But it is not absolutely deterministic. When you say, I am having something that is being used to build, something that is build or something, sorry, when you're having something that's being used to drive how you're building out something that you're going to be built for, or that represents this billing item. It has to be very, very deterministic, so that assembly right is, regardless of what AI even has today, the data store from an AI is not going to go and change how that assembles together, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2  18:43 Yeah. Like, that's a fair point. So, yeah, that's\n\nSpeaker 1  18:47 you might have AI that says, okay, like, where I could see maybe this is going is like, okay for these plans, or these, these, you've now got what are and now calls these kind of, like, billable items, or with the entitlements and your search may say, Okay, well, go through, you know, more of an AI search vector store to get to these items that you then run rules on today, calculated\n\nSpeaker 2  19:14 out, well, the only thing that's missing from here is the behavioural data is upstream data, right? So this lens begins from the catalogue in woods, for example.\n\nSpeaker 1  19:25 Well, you would say that it would come through, like, in this case, like your API endpoint that would say, Okay, I either know about, you know, Jonathan's subscriptions, or I know about the metadata that comes from, you know, how you're browsing on the page, something that represents you that somehow influences how this thing is produced?\n\nSpe",

And the question I was asked with a graph is, if I can do, if it's not complex multi hop, then why use a graph, right? So we we managed to build the build this graph that had the behavioural data all the way through to the account, the subscription, number of invoices generated, and also the CRM the reason for cancellation, or, I think, was expired or cancellation. I can't remember when we found CRM equals price was the reason for the cancellation. So it was a really good way of visualising behavioural data and transactional data, which is typically something that Zora doesn't have. So the only thing that I'm interested in, one of the things I'm interested in is, is if we own, so we look thinking about, how do we use mediation to capture behavioural signals, right? You know, distance travelled for connected\n\nSpeaker 3  20:44 services, you want to do them like ETR job from the different source of data with some mediation. And I wouldn't be some ETR tools to well, it could be, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2  20:57 it would be ETL, but be very high frequency. So it'd be like, super, like, yeah, very, very, not, not, you know, it's kind of Kafka s not Kafka Kinesis, like, just kind of streaming data. So, yeah, ETL for so they could do batch ETL for some but you need something a bit more performance. But anyway, that's that, that my point is, is that this to me, as long as the as long as the inputs into this are both inward looking, which is the Billing products, right, the catalogue? Well, not billing product, because the catalogue and everything that begins from there, but it's also outward, like, how would we if we're collecting this data? How would behavioural data get into this? What would he come in as?\n\nSpeaker 3  21:42 I think, I think it's three ways. What was that three? Three approach, right through. Approach for some things is that, if there was these, I call these things like rules or filter together, work together, maybe it is the court decision or logic, even this logic is do not change very frequently, and they can just working like pipelines. All the data's data may be changed very much, but logic do not change much. In this case, we can use leverage, leverage or push mode, like car or something message queue or something to send to our CC term, to apply each of the data and to do the it also.\n\nSpeaker 2  22:34 It also depends on the use case, right? So, yeah, depends on, depends like up here, if you were doing B to C, just this plan that was drawn here would might change, yeah, based on the use at the user level, yeah, let's say they had three subscriptions before they have had trial before, something like that. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3  22:56 Okay, so what's the second? Approach is okay. I mean that there was one approach is context builder. Do you think this distance is good? This is why it's good, because, based on users the input, maybe the input is on demand.\n\nUnknown Speaker  23:18 That's really from BCS, right?\n\nSpeaker 3  23:20 Yeah, is yes? Is Yes? This guy responsible, assemble, assemble the catalogue that feels better, user stuff and contribute all the food is as a context. And this contest two, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2  23:37 that's what we drew.

Well, I can already see the reason. First of all, we have to kill the concept that Z rules is a use case. It's a lookup service. But we have to do that. If I say it's a lookup service, I need a I need some bullet points.\n\nSpeaker 1  24:13 It's a lookup for price. It's a lookup for prices. It is not something to assemble or run rules on okay?\n\nSpeaker 2  24:25 So everything, that's the starting point. We gave an example of a use case right? Previously, like, why Z rules is limiting. So we say that thing, and then we say, Okay, well, here's here's an example. There's another example. Let me give you a practical use case of what this can't do, which you gave earlier. Then we have this, this concept of what rules should be, or the orchestration engine, or whatever it's going to be, and how it interacts with context.\n\nUnknown Speaker  24:56 The bit that I guess is missing\n\nSpeaker 2  25:00 is how much surface area does this solve for? Right? You've got this engine. It solves for some business use cases today, but it must have some other utility. It feels like I would\n\nSpeaker 1  25:12 think this rules would eventually even go and do things like suggest, here are upgrade paths, or here are downgrade paths. So that context that comes in, there's nothing that says, if that rules framework is able to understand, okay, it's Tony, and he's got plan A and plan B. Out of that, that rule system can say, Okay, well, let me run rules that create options for upgrade pass or downgrade pass. Or, here are extra promotions, which represents a plan that might be a discount. Or, you know,\n\nSpeaker 2  25:51 that's, that's AI, I mean, that's kind of, that's like what sub X was doing. That's what was churn agent is building now, right? Is that, to me, feels like you can have, like, how would you get to the end of that path? Something's got to orchestrate that. So there's some intelligence that's got to orchestrate well.\n\nSpeaker 1  26:12 So to get to that path, like, for example, there in the catalogue, I had the team create what's called a purchased options endpoint. So it's not plan specific, it is not product. It's not charge. It is something that says what you can purchase. And from that, I would imagine extra data comes in, right, which changes how that API operates. So you can pass in your subscription you could be passing in the context that came from the page, IP address, or what",

That's the pathway, given the customer, given the available purchasing options, that's the thing that you put you should be presenting, right? Yeah, well,\n\nSpeaker 1  27:10 just becomes something that in that API. Another\n\nSpeaker 3  27:16 thing is confusing is that we just now we we talking about the rules, another ranges or something, another C term named constraints.\n\nSpeaker 2  27:28 What's that? Constraints? What is that?\n\nUnknown Speaker  27:38\n\nOur constraints? Okay, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 3  27:39 constraints, yeah, you have many options, right? Option one, option two, options three. For example, you buy the computer you have, you buy the motherboard. It's like\n\nSpeaker 2  27:54 CPQ constraints, right, correct, right. But is it the same?

I got you.\n\nUnknown Speaker  29:58 Okay, yeah. Okay. Do um, what would you do? Like, how would you approach this like?\n\nSpeaker 2  30:07 So, so let me tell you about the reason for the question is, I need to get the business lined up with the concepts, and then I need to deliver the concepts right. That's what I want to do. I don't want any I don't want any opacity. I don't want any kind of wiggling around. We've made the decision. This is the decision we're going in, and that's what we're going to build right then we judged on our engineering velocity. We either deliver it or we don't deliver it. But what I'm trying to do is get to a baseline now where we so we know exactly what we're delivering. That was the presentation that I did on Tuesday. So how would you? How would you approach this? Is this you Tony and nav in a room, direction of travel, build it out, and then, yeah, we resource it. Yeah. Are you? Are you on experiences or catalogue both? All right. Good, right. So your IC now, right? Yeah. Great\n\nSpeaker 3  31:02 guns, yeah. To do this in CIS approach. One is that I trying to figure out, is architecture stuff, at least, maybe in this architecture we can compile other concept or confusion stuff, yeah, so that our body can understand what you are building. Yeah, second thing that I am working on, quick POC about these things, and so that we can align, at least align from the concept, align from CPM to euros and nav roles. And do you,\n\nSpeaker 2  31:44 do you think? All right, then it feels to me like once you've valid it, so you've you've all validated this, you've created some kind of, you know, like POC or something that then gets wrapped up into a simple document that the rest of the business can understand. Yeah, and we make a statement that that's the direction of travel. So I've defined this as the intersection, right? Because what my pitch to the business was, if you don't own the intersection, the services that run commerce Foundation, they get duplicated or lost in individual road maps, right? So, for example, there's a bit in CPQ. There's there's a similar, but slightly different concept in in catalogue. And so what I wanted to do is just extract these out, not the engineering teams, not create a new team. Well, the\n\nSpeaker 1  32:40 concepts need to be extracted out and put into the central layer that runs everything. In this case, is the API layer, right?\n\nUnknown Speaker  32:48 So that I call it the intersection layer, but it's basically\n\nSpeaker 1  32:52 an API layer just exactly whoever's serving it up. So in this case, it's the catalogue service is technically serving up the data of what you can purchase. And so that's kind of the area which should be doing. Let's call it the rules combinations, x, y, z, CQ is then either reading from that. But the more that, least that you centralise that around the domain of who's got it, it at least, you know, you can apply it to different areas, like, so okay, like, is it, you know, if it can satisfy CPQ, well, then why can't it go and do other things like, okay, know how to recommend promotions that can show up underneath of an end customer, you know, Portal, right?

    "content": "o had a meeting with Errol nav and\n\nUnknown Speaker  33:46\n\nand Manfred.\n\nSpeaker 3  33:48 What's now's points? What's the name now, now? Now, looking this a long time.\n\nUnknown Speaker  33:56 What's What's his? Yeah, he has been working. Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 3  33:58 what was the navs points? One of these things. Yeah, I want to know what\n\nSpeaker 2  34:04 I what I pitched is a synthesis of nav and Errol and Manfred, so that we're completely lined up, completely lined up. And, you know, you could argue that this is just a translation. I'm just a translator. So I came to NAV and I said, Hey, listen, it seems really dumb that we've got this omni channel vision, but we can't work out how to get it done. So my pitch to you is I want this thing called the intersection layer, and I want to put rules engine BCS, not different teams. I just want to call it out, and I want to make the intersection a road map. It is a it's a foundational thing. And he said to me, I've been trying to do this for three years, right? And then I went to Errol, and Errol said, That's what initially, this is what I wrote up. And then I went back and read Errol's documentation after I'd run it through an LLM, because it's a bit complicated for me, right? And it and it was the same thing. So the beauty of this is it's just the same thing. It just has a Polish story to it. My job is to get it over the line, right? What I said in the pitch is, there's the story at the top right. That's easy to colour. I can do that all day long, right? The most input, there's the middle bit, which is the product catalogue, CPQ, etc. The most important bit is the bottom of the bun, the burger bun, right? So I think of it like a burger story at the top, lettuce, tomato, hamburger in the middle. And the bottom bit is the architectural bit. This is what we're talking about now, right? Agreement that we bring we build these services with a unified view of what they do, that we consume in a collective way. We make decisions across CPQ, commerce experiences in a collective way. That intersection is the thing we're building for, right? And the and the very interesting thing happened yesterday, right? So the other side to this is you cannot disrupt core roadmap. I can't go to Errol and say, Hey, I'm giving you a new dependency. I can't go to Manfred and say, Hey, I'm going to give you something new to do. What you have to do is you have to let the individuals recalibrate their own roadmaps very subtly. So we build for the intersection. Then Manfred and Errol have got to internalise that and go, okay, because if you think about Errol's brain or manfred's brain, there's a kind of a vector space there that I can't, I can't get involved in that, right? I don't want to be inside Errol's frontal cortex. He has to, he has to stack rank and subtly move stuff around and reorientate his own roadmap. Now he'll either do that well or not well. My bet is he'll do that well, Manfred will do that. Well, Jimmy will do that. Well on experiences, but we have to have a point of view at the intersection. And one of the benefits of you now coming into the team and you Taylor and nav, is that you have a holistic view of the intersection, right? You can guide the narrative across Errol. And man, you know, Errol is very forceful. He has a view, but ",

Shakir likes it. I'm not doing so listen, I said this, if I'm gonna do this, this is my view of the story. They like that view, but we now have to deliver it, so now let's just deliver it, yeah, but Taylor, you bought into this, right? You bought into this? Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  38:05 Well, you're removing certain of the, I would call it, maybe limitations, that are that the previous catalogue had. And if you don't have those, not limitations. But if you remove some of those assumptions, then you can make something that's more kind of flexible and dynamic.\n\nSpeaker 2  38:25 That's the story. I love it, okay?\n\nSpeaker 1  38:29 And then it shouldn't, you know, not take forever to build great.\n\nSpeaker 2  38:35 Okay, that's cool, man. Well, that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about, but we did it in a slightly different way. I like that, thanks Tony. More general, yeah, more general ways. Brilliant. I got to go to see nav, but let me just tell you, Oh no, I don't have to. It's fine. So does that? Does this kind of vibe with what you what gets you up in the morning like is doing this gonna move the needle for you?\n\nSpeaker 1  39:09 The bigger thing would be, I think the biggest thing around moving the needle is more around the experiences side, yeah, yeah, simply because the cost for, like, the cost drivers that kind of consulting has is always about, okay, what APIs do you have to integrate with? Yeah, if you can wrap things into an experience, a customer is then given a choice, agreed, they could say, I can either take the experience, and that might have say 10, or, let's call it six API's that are bundled into that you can get that working within. Let's call it a day, yeah. Or I've got the other option that says, Okay, I've got a month worth of dev time. Yeah, I agree with you. And if you've got that choice, okay, well, I'm betting most customers are gonna say, just give me this. Drop it in 100% and that will then reduce 100%\n\nSpeaker 2  40:02 I think experiences will be huge next year, yeah, and also experiences maybe multi channel next year like but I think my bet is we can make them omni channel very, very quickly.\n\nSpeaker 1  40:13 Well, the longest built in the correct way, how you deliver that experience can go to, really, any of those different channels, but\n\nSpeaker 2  40:20 it needs context for it to be omni channel, for the handoff to happen Correct.\n\nSpeaker 1  40:24 Well, it needs to, it needs to be a little the experience needs to be able to absorb what's on the page or what is being passed into instantiation.\n\nSpeaker 2",

Now that\n\nSpeaker 2  40:59 use you could, yeah, for an LLM to be something like mem zero, but you can persist the session. Sub X was doing it. We persisted audiences for a year.\n\nSpeaker 1  41:10 And we currently don't really have us. We don't have a way of persisting that. But I would assume that once you get the experience to start that will just become a natural evolution that says, Okay, well, the next thing says, Okay, well, let's absorb more data that comes off of that, but at least then, until you own the experience and what is injected, basically onto the browser, we've never been in a place as a company to be able To absorb that data. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2  41:41 And also, well, there's two use cases. This gives us a broader it gives us a way to persist with a longer lens or a longer time frame. But also, that's the substrate to the decisioning. Yes, right? So that's where the AI comes in. So when we think about decisioning, this session as a no utility decision. The session is a point in time delivery mechanism. It has some some useful context to it, like country, for example, but it doesn't it's the longer view of the customer that matters,\n\nSpeaker 1  42:14 correct, and that view has not well. We've never really been able to capitalise on that, because that would always rely on the customer being able to feed that data to us.\n\nSpeaker 2  42:29 Yeah. We want to build those that API layer, yeah, and maybe it's me, maybe we leverage mediation to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1  42:35 I think it would be enough, once you get the experience there, and that's absorbing. If that's already if that widget right is already on the browser, yeah, you can you get this at that point, you can go and say, Well, hey, let me silently go and add this other thing that goes and pipes it into temporal. And we could say, Well, okay, great. Even though that experience is driving it. There could be the temporal back end that actually understands, well, hey, wait a second, let's go. And you know, you haven't actually responded back then maybe that's emitting back to the experience to say, Well, hey, go and show a discount.\n\nSpeaker 2  43:12 Or, yeah, it's exactly the way sub X works. We actually deployed APIs in the back end, but you can do it to client side. You could do it. So you can do API.\n\nSpeaker 1  43:21 Well, it's just, you got to, you got to, you have to be running client side to even attempt to start trying to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2  43:27 Well, I mean, it's what I meant was you can either JavaScript or you can do you can, well, it's the same thing. Is still an API. So, yeah, client so\n\nSpeaker 1  43:38 you have to be operating on the client side to start attempting to do that.

Though I don't know many, I don't know much of the rest of the org that that really understands how powerful that catalogue is. Customers do when I speak to customers. They get it because they know what the limiting factors are. Anyway. That's a separate conversation. So I agree with you on experiences. I think the problem with experiences is the velocity at the moment. Yeah, it's just too slow, yeah. So I'm going to try and escalate that I spoke to Errol today. I think as a skew, experiences could be one of the biggest revenue generators for the company next year.\n\nSpeaker 1  44:40 Well, I would actually, you, I would actually be trying to give it out for free, right? Well, you free, not free, but you're, you're looking at it because, for example, if it's a lowering sow costs, right? Well, that's only going to go promote more deals to be sold. So you don't necessarily\n\nSpeaker 2  44:57 like, well, listen, as long as somebody puts $1 value to it. I don't care. I'm not a big fan of lowering. So, W, let, let, let the GS, AI motion lower. So. W, well, we'll, yeah, I've got views on that as well, but, but, but actually, that's a very good point. I wish I had more time with you. Very good point. Is one thing I could go all over the place on this, but the other thing that bothered that I can never get a straight answer to is I like arvin's got one view. Annie Wood's got another view. Pete, Pete and Satish and Shakir have got another view. But I spoke to a partner the other day in the UK, and I said, What would it take if I wanted to do PL like sales, self serve? So we build commerce foundation. You can have a self serve experience as you grow, you get sales assisted. As you get really big, you get complex, you know, you do sales led and so that what we're building in commerce foundation is this omni channel that allows you to move up and down the slider, right? So you can do any kind of sales motion, all of this power in the background. But then someone comes to you as a $50 million $100 million SaaS company and say, yeah, we can do all of that. Was going to cost you $300,000 to get the billing implementation done.\n\nSpeaker 1  46:25 They normally, those big companies, they don't care about, you know, paying, you know, normally they, they don't,\n\nSpeaker 2  46:31 but the smaller company, there's a lot of companies that we lose deals to that don't want to pay $200,000 to implement something right,\n\nUnknown Speaker  46:39 which is, comes down to onto the experience\n\nUnknown Speaker  46:41 part, yeah. But what could, how do you mean\n\nSpeaker 1  46:44 most of those, so W's, right? They like, for example, GS charges based off of the per API, right? So if you look at like a for a customer to go live, you need to go and have the catalogue right. And historically, that was problematic because that was a very slow API. So you have to go put caching on front of that. You then have to go do the RSA API call. You got the next API call to then display the HPM. After you get that, you then have to go do the order preview. After that, you have to go do the ",

Each API call from GS, they would scope out a week worth of effort. So just to get off the bat with a simple or just a, you know, pixels, which should be out of the box, takes six weeks.\n\nSpeaker 2  47:36 So there's, there's a few ways to skin it, right? So you got Arvin that's trying to get nine month implementations down to six. The other thing is that I, what I couldn't understand is when I actually went in and looked at a billing implementation for a small for, you know, $50 million SaaS company, which is pretty small, you know, why do we not have a reference architecture?\n\nSpeaker 1  48:00 I would say you could have a reference architecture, like, for example, like that, how I said that kind of sequence? Yeah, sure. That's kind of what all customers kind of have to go and do just to get live. But okay, well, because there is, because Zora, historically, is a server you have to communicate to the service, not client side. You You know that customer's back end is in Java, this other customers and is in whatever, you know, C sharp, right, or Python. It's not like we've got something that's transferable, that can be directly kind of plopped in, that shortens that\n\nUnknown Speaker  48:41 we must have done it 100 times, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 1  48:44 but then putting it into something that is so just\n\nUnknown Speaker  48:47 lives in GS as a custom implementation, yeah?\n\nSpeaker 2  48:52 And when you when GS is a revenue stream, then you can understand why that happens, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1  48:58 Well, the incentive structure is not about trying to reduce, not reduce friction, but where, for example, like that, you don't get the frictions that you would get normally in that you see in GS don't get translated into either making the API simple or reducing the number of steps that you have to execute. So, like the good a good example, is that, okay? What that order call for example, right? That is slow. You know, once it has to go talk to the payment once it has to go and talk to the taxation system, and then it has to go talk to the payment system, to go and capture it, those are things that are out of our zone of control, yeah. And if you if engineering, you know, kind of like we lost the we lost the HBO deal to to stripe, because stripe, you know, could go in control, and it could get to the throughput that we couldn't because they don't have those, you know, dependencies to downstream systems that they have no control over, or we have no control over. Yeah, and the only way and that, like, you know, this comes to down to that whole argument that says, you know, why are you making, you know, the experience. Why ",

Doesn't solve for what we call our segment three, which is sub 100 million, which has got a massive Tam. But we're very, very bad at winning in it.\n\nSpeaker 1  50:42 That's and that's the whole point of the experience, because if you can deliver,\n\nSpeaker 2  50:47 are you so you saying that? So All right\n\nSpeaker 1  50:50 experiences, because they bundle up, what is the objective function into something that can be dropped on client side, that can reduce the sow cost dramatically, right? So, what about\n\nSpeaker 2  51:04 the implementation of core, but of billing, though, because that thing is over engineered for a lot of use cases,\n\nSpeaker 1  51:09 that implementation of bill. So there is, you have to implement the API's of billing versus I have to go configure billing. Configure billing is always going to be kind of that cost. And AI might go and help you, you know, reduce that.

We can't, we can't, we can't be missing.\n\nUnknown Speaker  51:42 I mean, if this is your website right,\n\nSpeaker 1  51:47 right, and you you've now just bought to the Zora, right, and I need to go, let's just say there are tabs right here for, you know, payments, yeah, you know, invoices. You know, tab for my subscription, yeah, another tab for,\n\nUnknown Speaker  52:04 like, yeah, we said this is the experience layer, right, correct.\n\nSpeaker 1  52:07 So this is, this is your, this is your website, right. So right now, and here's the back end, right, yeah, and let's just call this as a Python right,\n\nSpeaker 2  52:17 right now, is this an internal system, or is this a c2 facing?\n\nSpeaker 1  52:20 This is, this is the c2 face. Okay, right? This is the, here's the c1 back end, right. Now, to go and do this, they have to then build this UI. They then have to go make this, and then here's now, Zora, right? They have to build this over here. They have to build this over here. And for what they're trying to go and do they just want to have something that says, show my payment list and all this other stuff. So to make this thing work, and let's also say there's something to add new payment method, this would take about, let's call it 10 different APIs that they would have to integrate. Now, if I can give a widget right that says, you know, and when I configure this widget, maybe I turn this on, turn this on, turn this on. But if I drop that widget in, and you can go and do that, this thing now is talking directly to Zora, all you had to do was drop this in and you remove all of this. Does that make sense? So now there's no who care if this is Python or if this is Java, and\n\nSpeaker 2  53:30 then you don't care that the customer still goes into the billing portal. Well, the our own billing port.

I take a payment, and when I change\n\nSpeaker 1  54:32 my payment method, I want you to show my, you know, my bill to my soul, to maybe update that, right? The it is not something that says,\n\nSpeaker 2  54:39 but this is also, this could be, this is c2 this is, this could also be c1 into their own systems, right? Well, a lens,\n\nSpeaker 1  54:47 well, so this is now c2 but say, if you build this out right now, over here, you know, c1 let's call this the sales person, right? Yeah, this and they go and say, let me search by this account ID, right? Okay, this thing that's true, Omni channel, now it drops into here. Yeah, it's brilliant. Okay, now that\n\nSpeaker 2  55:06 I'm gonna go and ask a few people about if they see the problem the same way, because it sounds entirely logical. So, what?\n\nSpeaker 1  55:13 That's what, like, Gs on the on the so w, they charge for every single connection here, right? So if this is the, you know, but\n\nUnknown Speaker  55:21 what if they just doing cookie cutter, same thing over\n\nUnknown Speaker  55:24 but that's what I'm saying, is in that lower\n\nUnknown Speaker  55:26 they've got no incentive to sell. We've already done that, though.\n\nSpeaker 1  55:29 Well, in that lower tranche, for those customers that are, you know, their their use cases are pretty simple, yeah, you're right. And they just want something where they can quickly drop it in, and that's where, okay, hey, you've got the option. You go take this. You can maybe change the colouring, you know. You can take this. You can get live within, you know.\n\nSpeaker 2  55:50 Well, now we can prompt this when we, when we finally close this plasmid contract, we can, you could prompt that out. Well, you could, you could compose a page like this easily, because the\n\nSpeaker 1  56:02 well, it just becomes part of the default template. Now it's part of plasmic, right? Okay, well, this gets built out now. Say, if they need to go and change this, well, then you get something where it says, Okay, I'll fork this. I can go and add my own API here. Whatever you don't really care.\n\nSpeaker 2  56:16 Tell me something. I'm assuming Errol buys this. Okay, so,\n\nSpeaker 1  56:20 but it's you're removing connection points, right? So you had to go and pay you either you personally had to go build this U",

You just drop that in, and we'll take care of this.\n\nSpeaker 2  56:37 Is a very valuable lens, because I don't think this has been really well conveyed. Is that experiences as an unlock for our segment three, which is sub 100 million, yeah, but that's a story.\n\nSpeaker 1  56:48 So those customers that don't have, they do not have their complexity. It's not a, it's not a, it's not a Twilio, right? That has some crazy, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2  57:01 I called this billing light, but I think I began at the wrong place. I began at the c1\n\nSpeaker 1  57:09 it's more the CC two, yeah, it is, because that's where, that's where the cost I'm sure there might be, like, for example, that one. There might be something there that says, okay, my support staff, right, needs\n\nSpeaker 2  57:23 to be services, whatever, whatever. But that's all context, though.\n\nSpeaker 1  57:27 That's just, that is just, it's displaying the same thing, but in a different, yeah, with different\n\nSpeaker 2  57:31 permissions in that correct. Well, that's all right. So, so experiences isn't, is both an omni channel, go to market story for ourselves teams, it's also has a double value for smaller, less complex customers, because it helps accelerate time to value or time to life. Yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1  57:59 Why do we lose just right stripe is easy, like you you know, you go and implement that, you drop the widget in, and you're done. Now that doesn't\n\nSpeaker 2  58:06 what I guess, honestly, what I don't understand is everyone in the in the in the commerce team, and including, I'll put Zephyr to one side for a second, but everyone in the commerce team, in one shape or another, has expressed the sim. I mean that's because you all kind of have a similar view about what the problem statement is and what the out what the solution should be, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  58:28 So debate, I mean, Jimmy, Jimmy is also,\n\nSpeaker 2  58:31 yeah, Jimmy, I can see that, yeah. I mean, listen, Jimmy did May, you went on the news court presentation. We I said to him afterwards, that was first class, he answered every single question. Didn't even bat an eyelid. And he should be doing that everywhere. He should be talking to customers everywhere, even if we're not that level of product knowledge is really hard to translate, because he understood well, you both understand, but he did a very, very strong presentation. So, so what I don't understand, and I've not seen this in many companies before, none of the companies that bought my businesses before have I ever seen this is that there is a very smart group of people that know the direction that we should travel in, but there seems to be this friction in getting to that point, like, why is this just not baked in? What to the organisational thinking? Is it a translation issue? I think it's\n\nSpeaker 1  59:33 a it's an issue where you've got GS that's a separate wing, right? And those frictions are kind of just the status quo, right? And it's true. How, how do you go in, like, if you're, if you're GS, or if you're billing, right? You kind of kind of are saying, like, Okay, well, yeah, al",

It doesn't make them any money they are. They just need to provide the minimum amount to basically be able to allow for a customer to access their payments, their invoices, their contact information.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:00:26 So, so tell what I'm going to do. I want to play this so we've got an implementation partner called clariss in Europe, who did the immediate media thing. Would you ask them? No, I want you to get on a call with them. Okay, I want to. I don't want to get in the middle of it. I want to be on a call with Clarissa and you. And I want you to to share that thinking and see from a customer that does is the competitor to Gs, who's been doing implementations of billing and CPQ since 2017 so they know Zora inside out. They started with reference architecture. If you give me a reference architecture for sub 100 million, I can get it live in 60 in 60 days or 45 days, right? That's their opening statement. You're bringing a different lens, which is, Listen, this is what experiences is. And so what I'd love to do is, I'd love to get Jimmy on the call to demo the experiences, like, what does that thing actually do? And then for you to say, Listen. And here is a implementation. This is the story around implementation. I'd love to just, you know, if you can get a partner to go fuck me, if you give me that, it's going to change how we go to market, because they have a, you know, they're very big in the European market. Now, what I'm trying to do is build into, I want to internalise some of these stories and then force this type of motion through the business. Yeah, would you? Yeah, I'm gonna set that up all right. And then, is there anything else that you want to share with me? I don't know. If you haven't got anything written, that's fine, but how do we there's a story here, there's a pitch here, there's a presentation here. Like, if I was going to elevate a pitch this, I'd put 10 slides together and say, and do that. I tell you what I'm going to do. Let me play back to you what I just heard now in maybe a three slides. And then if you say, yeah, you missed a bit, or that's kind of what I was saying, we go validate it with clarissis, and then I'm going to use that collateral wherever I can to say that's what also experiences does. And I want to see who pushes back in the business. Yeah, yeah, cool, man. It's really good. I mean,\n\nSpeaker 1  1:02:47 we built, like, in sales. They had this thing called Zillow. It was like a PHP and customers would say, Great, we'd like that. And they would have to go and say, well, we can't give that to you. That's just our own internal demo product. And because the thing was riddled with, like, you know, it was only built to go demo. It's not built as, like, a secure solution.

Some of the stuff we're talking about here is a, you know, I think Shakir sceptical that we could get an omni channel commerce experience up before the end of the next year. I think we can, right? If you think about the engineering velocity that we're getting out of AI, if you believe what moves selling, which is, we can two or 3x or engineering velocity, then I think we could get an omni channel out. But that's the longer lens. The shorter term lens is that what you've described is the is a immediate value prop for experiences. If we get, you know, if we accelerate the velocity of the experiences team, right? We have to, we have to do that, but I think experiences could be one of the largest revenue generators for the business next year. I'm not so bored on the let's help lower this.

For example,\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:04:46 yeah, you give, you could give one module,\n\nSpeaker 1  1:04:48 and then at that point you would you, you would accelerate. And I think by giving part of it, like, like, if you give account management for free, yeah, yeah, customers would say, Great, oh, I've already got that, and you were able to go and cut sow costs by, let's call it x percentage.

Three weeks to get my stuff documented and conveyed to you. I had meetings on it and conveyed because I have an end user experience I can show us. And look, this is the ready made cake. Look at it how it works. That's how I want it to work. I showed it to black line, to unity, to Frontify, to brand. They all say, yep, that's what we want. So good. So something like that needs to come. This goes with that. We are working on this right now, but at the end of the day, this is intricately linked together because a hard bundle is just nothing else than one form of a configured product. If you configure a product in one way, that's equal to be a hard bundle, in my opinion.\n\nSpeaker 3  9:52 And just to sorry to interrupt, but the vehicle for hard bundle delivery becomes the structure as well for the elements of configurable bundle.\n\nSpeaker 1  10:04 That's the sausage now, right?

Yeah, we\n\nSpeaker 2  10:13 lay the foundation is, sorry, and just, and again, these, some these, some of these questions might be naive. There is a dependency, or n",

It can solve world hunger, or can it be more something specific? So all of this, I usually, as a product manager, never really worry too much about it, because I work with engineers and architects, they make this type of decisions. I tell them what I need. I gave actually, that's what I did with Tony, you know, who is now in the catalogue group. I said, Tony and Leo. This is the use case. I gave them my spreadsheets where I have samples with rules and what have you. And said, This is what, how I wanted to behave. And they solved it. Okay, they use something, right?

So that's\n\nSpeaker 1  12:15 definitely right. The second piece that Tony was doing, which I never asked him to, but once I showed it, yeah, once he showed it to me, is that this is fantastic, you know, this is like dynamic categorization. What does it mean is, normally, you have a static categorization. You have products, you put them in categories, and you post it on your website, and like customers go from category to category to kind of found my product or they mostly now they search, but that was the traditional way. Categorization also is needed to find stuff when you're an admin, right? How do I find my product? Well, I travel down a category. How do I find my attributes? I have them categorised. How do I find anything? Customers, anything, any object, they have a lot of it. You need to put some organisation on top of it. You can do it very loosely by just assigning attributes or quantifiers or whatever, like labels properties. You can name it what you want, and you search by that and but categories are great. So what Tony did? He basically had a mechanism where he automatically looks into what are, what are the labels of the products, and he categorises based on that he is.\n\nSpeaker 3  13:25 So this was a we wrote this requirement a year and a half ago, as in order to get away from in order to get to a single catalogue and eliminate industry, country and other catalogue variants, you basically utilise dynamic categorization and presentation utilising Elastic Search. So this is how the cattle the reason I did this is, this is the next generation of commerce, right? This is how the entire industry works. ",

I'm not like huge in technology, but I'm saying this is really fancy. It has potentials to do a lot of great stuff, you know, like, for example, I want to present somewhere new arrivals of my products in the old world, I had to make sure that there's an administrator who put the new arrival products in the category new arrivals, with Tony thing he can just look at, when was the product created, or It's basically the date is a parameter can analyse and with a rule that says, Everything that's not older than three months is a new arrival, and it automatically appears in that category, which is, of course, way more flexible now the admin doesn't have to deal with it. It automatically happens. It's great. It's a fancy thing in you\n\nSpeaker 4  14:59 know, familiar going with that. But do you think we wanted or not? Because the reason we did it is simply because, in my head, that categorization was important for leading into the C, which is configurator, because without that, the configuration, dynamic configuration won't work. That's why we did it.\n\nSpeaker 1  15:14 That's not true. That's not true because people have did not have that in the past, and they could also configure so it's not necessary, but it's\n\nUnknown Speaker  15:26 better.

Now their story would be very simple, like it's with dynamic categorization. In the past, everyone did that. How did they do it? They said, You sales ops, you come up with the questions and the answers, and it guides a sales rep through a flow. Ask, there's a question, you answer, you get to the next question. You answer next question. That's very simple, right? So you think about as a person, how you get through that flow? Yes. Now again, the 10x team came, and they're great. They build a flexible questionnaire. That means the AI comes up with the questions the sales person or the sales ops guy doesn't have to author them anymore. Yeah, which is fantastic, but here's my kind of fear. Yes, all these the right questions could be but I'm sure if I would go into an experience, say, I have my AI prompt open, say, I don't know what to sell or help me find a product.\n\nSpeaker 2  19:50 But isn't that that?

And I see the problem. I want a better,\n\nSpeaker 3  36:35 different elevation here. I just, just to be clear, we've got to get product to market. Every one of these decisions is absolutely critical, and the opportunity cost and the big picture is something that we're all saying the same thing. But the reason I'm positioning it this way is, let me, let me. Let me just deviate for a moment. The average commerce platform takes 200 person years to deliver. And like, like I said, you've heard this from me before, Salesforce has 27 people on their catalogue. Elastic Path had 45 and so, because we're working with a lean team, we simply have to refine our focus to a segment that we can definitively win in declare it and 100% and say, This is why we made these decisions and trade offs. So then when Pete comes back and says, Oh, I've got a $20 million SaaS that we need to win. We say no, and we documented in the meeting, we said, battleground one is SAS. 50 is battleground two is complex enterprise with 53% the five of us in this room said, Well, if we're going after complex SaaS, and we're going after this vision, we're going to do this first, but that, but that is\n\nSpeaker 2  37:56 100% right, right? And I don't even think you have to talk about the contract. I think what we say is we laid it all out as a team. Let's give you a story. Guided selling, right? Guided selling was important for Manfred, your point, we have small teams, we have we have big deliverables. You decided to take an asset, absorb that asset, and make a subtle shift in your roadmap. That's the end of the story, as far as I'm concerned. I mean, just it, that's where this is, why I tried to say is that insulate the product teams to make the decisions, create the intersection as a forcing function to those decisions, and then let people who experience make these subtle, complex changes, you know, yeah, and then share it. And if you go, you know, if you go, I mean, we get to a point where you go, if you do that, I can't have this, right? That then becomes a dependency. A dependency is different to what we're talking about.\n\nSpeaker 3  38:51 So I think we're all aligned. I'm just going to say one thing, like, there's no such thing as a small decision in product management, because every decision definitively enables you to succeed and succeed against a group of customer pains, and that's why I this. I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill, and we can move on. But like these, these become big decisions, and we've been burned here. So what you need to help us do is like, like, you've got to get into the details. And I know you're not afraid of doing that, but like the calls that rolly and I report weekly to move, and we're in these meetings where he makes, why?\n\nSpeaker 2  39:34 Why is why does that happen?

You made a very you know, the kind of vector space that you're living in was guided selling you, then translated that and thought, okay, there's a there's a context to this. There's an implication. I'm going to run through all of my roadmap, and I'm going to immediately say, hey, there's possibly a shift here. You can't, you can't construct that. That's you have to make that decision. And if it's the wrong decision, I don't care. That's fine. You validate it. You say I'm making that decision, it would be impossible to go back and deconstruct that. I mean, if we've learned anything from LL, from the age of AI, is that we have a very complex decision structure in our brains. I mean, I just think we want to move fast. We do the big things that we can all coalesce around. And then there's going to be these subtle shifts, and then we play them back up. So you know what I've done? I've assimilated all of this.

Oh, no, I know that is very subtle here, but yeah, no, actually, I talked with nav and we, I talked with Lucas about this. This is a part of a T and C, min. How much is your min and how much is your maximum? It's a T and C in a higher contract. Because if you look at a contract, you have way other things, like, what's your price for this type of product, like this category product, I'm gonna get 50% discount for this type of product, I get 20% discount. That's another category of contract terms, yes, pricing. So we have commitments pricing, then we have payment terms. That's another type\n\nSpeaker 4  47:29 of more colour device. Okay, exactly. But can I just ask different than min and max? What we are supposed Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  47:38 Sorry, that's on price. Attracted me because I wanted to say what's different. This is based on an account level, or it is based on a group of products, or it's based on some other criteria, and you're gonna change it over, you know, you know, the first period is maybe the three months you're looking at, and then the next time you do get one year and you aggregate up and you compare to your commitment, right? So that the all of these factors go into these commitments. It's not that simple, okay? It has some complexity, and we're gonna have to enable that in CPQ, and that's exactly where the problem starts, because that's not a CPQ problem. It is a contracting problem. It's a\n\nSpeaker 4  48:19 contract problem, but let me that's where the colour comes in. Now I think so.

I understand vibe quoting, understand that's a teen thing, but that I hear we have to put a lick of paint on cpqx, because that's the thing we're selling. We're also building next gen CPQ, or next generation of CPQ. So I need to get more from what that direction seems like. You've got these parallel cameras\n\nSpeaker 1  57:02 together for you, right? Okay, so the first thing we talked about with Configure products that is already next gen. Why is it next gen is not going to happen on Salesforce, right? Right? That's why it's next gen. Okay, that's the definition. That's the definition for me. Yeah. And then advanced approvals.

That's a that's a that's\n\nSpeaker 1  59:21 yes it is and it isn't. So it is not that I if everything is perfect, I just consume it, right?

The company works on a different type of discount, which is a charge model, and that's not good enough. Can't have that in CPQ, so you can have it, but it doesn't do the right thing.

I do not know if you have agreed with the people now, because whenever we do any pricing modifications in the catalogue, the rating is not in the control of catalogue. Billing is not in the control of catalogue. Bringing them along, for me had been a tremendous challenge. So for me, I still question some days that who owns the pricing models?

Let's figure out how to get Tony engaged and everyone aligned and like as a leadership team, making sure that everyone is excited about the direction. So we'll have that on Thursday. I'm going to play this back, and please do so. We're talking about the big picture, and the most important thing is number one, getting Pete teen the field and others excited where we have failed in the past, and I'm just going to be very transparent, is I've walked into teens office and been like, there's a $13 billion market called commerce, and every customer in the World either sells through sales reps or an assortment of channels, etc, and then he goes off this philosophical and you would get this Amdocs, World of like, why call it a product catalogue? Why don't you call it an offering catalogue? And like, then we go to and he just, he just doesn't understand it, right? So we're now taking and being a little facetious, but like, we use these into these broader concepts, and like, sales gets it and the rest of the business doesn't. It's astonishing. I don't know if you've seen this, but sales is like, I know I want my customers want to package, price and sell, yeah, give it to me, and then you go to other people, and they're like anyway, so with the first audience, as you go top down is getting sales and everyone excited, there's really two different growth sales models. There's self service and there's seller assisted. So self service, obviously being a website, and even on the farthest left off the chart would be agents, because now an agent you don't even to serve yourself, the agent serves you, and on the far right is a sales rep. In that spectrum are things like, I start on the web and I jump over, vice versa, IVR, whatever context, session switching, yes. So true. Omni channel, yeah. So this is the Omni this\n\nUnknown Speaker  6:07\n\nis just a representation\n\nUnknown Speaker  6:08 of the omni channel, each of the surfaces, if you will. And the\n\nSpeaker 2  6:11 reason I put it here is so that the business can attach what our go to market is and what the product actually is designed to deliver.\n\nSpea",

    "content": "er 1  6:22 Right? And so there's, let's not get buried in nuance and just say there's a our business has failed with segmentation and go to market multiple times. We have a discussion about, like, what the heck is this complex? We're not going after complex enterprise, yet they are our biggest segment. And so like, part of what Jonathan's trying to do is like, let's not talk about SAS and plg and media. Let's just talk about we're going to sell through every channel, whether your self service or assisted. So that's like thesis number one. Now in order to do that, left to right. You have to have these experiences for all of these surfaces. You have to understand the context. You then have to by understanding the touch point, sorry, the surface and the context. You can then orchestrate and formulate the perfect experience. So where we get a little stuck is orchestration and actions, which those are kind of nav words.\n\nSpeaker 2  7:27 I like the idea. I like the I like the orchestrate and formulate the right experience. Yep, the right experience. I think that that's a better way of that's a better way of describing that. It's one block of things we orchestrate based on the context. We orchestrate and formulate the experience. Okay, that's what we're going to call it that. So rather breaking out another concept of actions, where people go, what are actions? We have actions over here. We have actions over there. We just say, Listen, you know, once you've you deliver the experience. The context tells you about the customer, the session, bless you. We then orchestrate and formulate the experience that ends up in one of the you know, this is, and I'm going to tell the story that this is a see, to hear, presses a button, speak to the agent, goes off to a different experience. Both of those have slightly different views given the context, but they they share a common view of the customer just through different representations, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  8:32 So I guess when you said orchestrate and formulate, I just I combined them as like, I'm going to kind of bring it all together, or, I guess I'm just still caught, and so the rest of the story is, actions are domains or business processes. It's, what are you going to do? I'm going to package, price, promote, configure, I'm going to upgrade, downgrade, I'm going to do things based on the context, yes and or what's my what's my reason of engagement. And I know why nav uses actions, and so like this is what I said earlier. I don't disagree with the use the word actions is just ambiguous. Actions. Well, what is it a user action? Is it a business action? Is it a domain? Is it a package? Price, promote, renew, like\n\nSpeaker 2  9:24 I think, I think, for the purpose of tomorrow, we just say, orchestrate the right experience that no one's gonna go hey, you missed our actions here.\n\nSpeaker 1  9:33 Well, I this is a good debate. Debating actions. So good orchestrate. I knew orchestrate and optimise are very important, right? Because that's the best, next best action, or no, no,\n\nSpeaker 3  9:49 hang on, why orchestrate would be? Orchestrate is kind of you're stringing some things together and you're trying to manage that optimise. Agree,",

    "content": "that's the next best action. But if I choose that next best action, you go to orchestrate that?\n\nSpeaker 1  10:06 Yeah, so orchestrate and optimise. How about we just do that? The thing that I'm stuck on, and I know exactly what you mean with actions like, what am I here to do today? Am I here to upgrade, downgrade? Are you going to package price, promote, renew? It's all the actions. But because actions is an ambiguous\n\nSpeaker 3  10:27 word, I'm working with the terms. Replace the terms. What do you got? No, but like, that's the question.\n\nSpeaker 1  10:32 Do we want to call it domains, business processes? What will everyone in that room? So the win forget about what we want to pitch. The win is Pete having a big heart here and being like, I love that. It's getting sales, and everyone in the room being like, I understand this. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2  10:49 So why don't we just call it why do we have to have, why don't we just call it orchestrate? What do we have to\n\nSpeaker 3  10:54 have an action? Is this thing? So the orchestrator and actions the way I thought, let me explain that. Basically, orchestration means there are going to be bunch of actions that you got to execute to achieve a business process. Business Process is a bigger deal. So we got to implement what, what is one atomic action in Zora, one of the biggest problem is you cannot even execute an atomic action without stringing together five API calls. Then you bring those things together. That's why we like workflow so much. Then you orchestrate that. So there has to be some abstraction of actions from commerce point of view that Zora doesn't have today, except for saying that, let's say I will. What is an order in Zora? Is it a verb? Is it a noun? You have been here for two years? Tell me you may. Or yeah, anybody? What is what is an order? Is it a verb in Zora, or is it a noun? In Zora? It's a noun, it's a noun. Should it be a verb, or should it be a noun? It should be a verb. There you go. So now, if a customer, if a customer goes and talks about, hey, I want to place an order, or I'm, going to then execute an order like they need an engineering degree to understand what the order API is. So the abstractions for me are like, upgrade order. That's an action. What do I need to do for that? That's comes in orchestration now.\n\nSpeaker 4  12:18 So are you not mixing? It's a business process you want to\n\nSpeaker 3  12:22 Orchestration is for a business process which then execute five steps or five tasks, five actions, orchestrating.\n\nSpeaker 2  12:31 So here's a coordination of the actions that are disparate.\n\nSpeaker 3  12:34 Correct. And sometimes you might have decision making in there and say that I'm going to skip this action.\n\nSpeaker 2  12:39 I'm going to go. Is that solving a Zora problem, or is that, I mean, you're saying you wouldn't tackle there are always going to be multiple actions you can take, right? Your business is just too complex, yes. So therefore you have to have some intelligent orchestration, that is, that understands this context, that understands what it needs to orchestrate, or how it should orchestrate correct, and then that orchestrates the actions in order to deliver the experience well.\n\nSpeaker 1  13:08 And I would say, I'm just gonna that's like, if I know you read the document within, like, I we needed a better name for mood, the orchestration and optimization.

But you know, there, there are business objectives that change with the context of engagement. So like all of that works together, the actions then\n\nSpeaker 3  13:45 are, you can leave it to literally at the bottom, that there are some action that we have to do. I only advocated for that is because we keep on forgetting that that is something that we need to polish, without which our exp, our whole thing will not complete.\n\nSpeaker 1  14:01 I'm going to go super old school, and I'm going to play something different back to you for debate. So in a world\n\nSpeaker 3  14:09 this is, this is what happens when me nails come together. So, yes,\n\nSpeaker 2  14:12 luckily, I like it. So, so I enjoy the, enjoy the narrative.\n\nSpeaker 1  14:17 In a world of systems of record, right there, there are, there's an SAP promote there's a Pegasus promotion system. There's a Zora billing back office. There's, there's all these things, right? And so the whole reason a commerce platform, and there's a reason I'm going here, so just bear with me. The whole reason that a Shopify exists is Shopify is not your your billing system of record, your product, whatever it is, literally, yes, a representation of those actions that's super high performance, yes. So yes, that's why I said I'm going old school, yes. If we go new school and we look at this new paradigm of like, where these new\n\nSpeaker 3  15:02 ACP and all that you're saying, you're referring to those, yeah, these lie. Yeah, yeah. So now, if you're absolutely gonna go new school and have the vision for that, in my opinion, Zohar will be fossilised,\n\nSpeaker 1  15:20 absolutely, that's exactly what I've asked.\n\nSpeaker 3  15:23 So Zora, as we know today, will be fossilised and should be fossilised as well. So it would be Salesforce. But the way that I believe this will come out, we will have a bunch of tools that I expose for an intelligent orchestration engine. So better us coming up with it. Then you can not only use your actions, you can use others actions to achieve something, and then you can be just a system to capture. This is the outcome which Zora, anyway, captures. But you, you forget about it. How did you arrive at it? You just happen to say, Oh, you, you capture something in Shopify. Don't worry. You can bring it here. And I can call this, I can bring it together. It feels like\n\nSpeaker 2  16:02 what we want, what we want is the permission to focus on this, to answer exactly that question. So what I'm, what I'm what I think the point that you're making, Earl is that what we don't want to do is use a word that everyone then that the room, you know, someone like Tamworth puts his hand up or not, puts his hand up and goes out. Wait a second. You know that means that, what are you actually talking about? And then the whole presentation stops. Right? True. So if we just call, if we, if we, if, if we say, if we were to be kind of reductive about it, we say experiences, context, orchestration. Do we have to mention actions?\n\nSpeaker 1  16:39 Well, there's a question. There's the reason I went down this path, right, which is, is commerce? And you know, again, there's the fo",

He's bridged the worlds very well. But the reason I go here is now everything else, the promotions, the merchandising, packaging, everything can be net new services that go into the action. So the question is, that's like a traditional commerce platform says back office is, is doesn't serve the need. Like, do we, do we softly position that. Or do we go to a new world and just say, Screw all of that. We're going to the ACP like MCP, ACP world, right? Agent to commerce. MCP, where we're just, you keep your garbage in the back.

The customers build it using those platforms, but more importantly, they would prefer the vendor that has the largest coverage, the biggest surface area on either MCPS or the ACPs of the world, because then it allows me to build my own customer experiences. The bigger I am, more I can afford those experiences, and more I would want to stick with you, because you offer everything for that. The latter approach of going and focusing on ACP MCP is better, but you cannot build that, and then you cannot go out to the market starting next month. So what we need to do is, what we have start piecing them away and say, Let me wrap it, put the lipstick of MCP on it. Why will we change that? Because in Zora, one thing for sure, we cannot change everything in one go.\n\nSpeaker 2  19:22 Well, the other forcing function is, I want to present this sko so I want, I want your commerce vision.\n\nSpeaker 1  19:30 Well, then yeah, said, Let's not go too far in the future. Like I we can sell all of these.\n\nUnknown Speaker  19:36 So I'm just interested in what you said, recipes,\n\nUnknown Speaker  19:40\n\nindustry accelerators.\n\nSpeaker 2  19:42 So what I want to just focus on that you said, Do we take merchandising, for example, and turn it as an as an action? Is that? Is that? What I heard you say, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  19:54 So, like, the way, the way we're moving forward is, like, as a traditional commerce so, like, you need some logical guardrails, right? So, like, let me simplify this so all of these would ultimately be actions, but it's, it's how we deliver the actions and what we focus on. And so do we say we're going to create all of these net new domains and or do we say, Screw the domains? We're just going full AI and doing these like ",

We just use, without using this acronym, yeah, just so we just say,\n\nSpeaker 2  21:53 Listen, that's all because that's already, you know, documented, you know, I'm going to, it's in one of your documentation documents. So that's orchestration of the experience, right? So no one's gonna go, Hey, you missed the step. It's actions. And then if someone does, then that's where one of you two can say, actually, you know, we've been debating this, you can help me out.\n\nSpeaker 1  22:12 I would just, I think it flows, and then in actions, just so you connect with the room. I would literally, do, you know, business processes, and then, you know, underneath those you do like the architecture. It's how these two things get, yeah? So it's package, it's package, merchandise, price, promote,\n\nSpeaker 2  22:34 yeah, okay.

So rather than this being consumed inside, I think we should say, How is commerce foundation going? Right? Well, you know, BCS has expanded, orchestration, Moose has grown, experiences and interactions is now doing this thing. That's the commerce foundation.\n\nSpeaker 3  23:53 I'm there, but the next person will ask you the question at this time is Satish, like, Oh, my God, this is surprise to me. If it's a road map item, who's delivering it?\n\nSpeaker 2  24:02 You know, I pitched him today, very briefly, and I said, I speak to him tomorrow. I said that everything except So, this exists, this exists, right? This doesn't exist, but it's written up. It's documented by Errol. It's needed. It's needed, right? Yes. So I'm assuming actions and orchestration go hand in hand, yes. So recipes doesn't exist. That's a stretch.\n\nSpeaker 3  24:28 Anyway. That's probably anyway, once you have all those things you can build, and I think what I'm going to use the word arrow, use accelerators. Yeah, people will probably relate better with accelerators than recipes. That's just my okay, but then, but yeah, at the end. So what Satish?\n\nSpeaker 2  24:47 Satish is bought into this the intersection. He believes in. So the only difference is, number one, it looks like most of the most of it. Well, in fact, well, I can't see anything that lives in CPQ. This is all living in, in the commerce team, right? This is the mission, right? So this is, this is fam. So this became, has to be a customer to all of this, so, but that's my point. So this is where the join is. There's a shared concept of what this is, and it gets built in this team. And this, this team gets resourced to deliver that thing. And if this is the, this is the lever, if you don't resource that, then you don't get omni channel, and you don't get CPU, don't get cells self serve to Well, leave CPQ out. From when you don't get self serve to sales assisted. You've got nothing to present at sko and the whole story of acquisition to cash and cells falls apart, right? You just don't have a story. Yeah, so I want to just raise the stakes and say, if you don't resource this, then your decision is right, then you've got the wrong people delivering it. We'll just deliver catalogue and CPQ, and then CPQ, and that's it. You can have all of that stuff, right, but you're not going to get the story the bit, the bit that's failed is that someone has to coordinate the CPQ team and the experiences team. I mean, you're running experiences, but it it from an architectural, from a kind of architectural point of view, everything has to be joined up, right? I mean, I know you run Jimmy and right? Jimmy's done an extremely good job on experiences. But with CPQ, what it can't be as a dependency, it's got to be, listen, here's the pattern. This is how CPQ is going to consume it. So teach needs to take that, internalise that, and make sure that thing happens.\n\nSpeaker 1  26:39 We can get there, I think I, and I agree with your vision. I believe that, you know, we need to move one step at a time. There's an incredibly large legacy instal base and multiple versions.\n\nSpeaker 3  26:55 Yeah, no, no, it's not a good CPQ, legacy.

The way that is going to be built this next gen CPQ is next gen CPQ, Legacy CPQ. We empathise with those customers, but at the same time all the functionality, and there's a document I wrote on that I was showing Jonathan as well. You will take away the functionality, slowly, backend functionality, and you will redirect it to the next gen, CPQ core, with commerce Foundation, the UI, Legacy UI may remain the same for now, until we figure out this experience can be or the components of these experiences can be, I framed into Salesforce, but the those\n\nSpeaker 2  27:44 will be the stages stories. The same, though, is that you don't get this and the the other thing is, is that, although it's not directly in this intersection layer, if you don't treat CPQ in this in the same, if you don't have the same framing of commerce foundation for CPQ, you just create two different services so that what you were talking about is that I want to configure rules in one place. I want context in one place. I want all of these things to orchestrate the complete commerce experience, which includes quote to cash as well as it does\n\nUnknown Speaker  28:18\n\nthis self series,\n\nSpeaker 3  28:21 this, I can bet you, next gen CPQ is not going out very much quickly, out of the door, and will not get a lot many customers very quickly. The momentum is there. But I personally believe CPQ selling doesn't happen like conventional selling, so this kind of motion is needed to catch them young and then grow them onto the CPQ as well. It's not going to be that everyday customers are going to wake up and businesses are going to wake up and say, let me transform my CPQ, well,\n\nSpeaker 2  28:50 Darren Johnson, this is not very politically correct, but he said his customers would rather change their gender than change their CPQ, yeah. It's not a thing they want to do, and vibe quoting is not going to make any money, because it's going to be just the playground on top of the CPQ.\n\nSpeaker 1  29:08 And deal room doesn't even like, who knows what that is like. The whole thing doesn't align with market Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2  29:15 So my but my point is, is that if CPQ becomes a sore then I can deal with that CPQ thing, but I know the foundation is strong. That's the That's the thing I, I, what I, what I don't understand about the this is, this is obvious, right? Like as a non commerce person, and I step back, I see, well, the only way you deliver these two things is by having this kind of unified view of one thing and then put people who know how to deliver it in charge of it. It seems like I just don't understand why that's not\n\nUnknown Speaker  29:59 done. Respond, because I give you my reasons.\n\nSpeaker 1  30:02 It's simple. And, I mean, you know it, but please don't share it. It was a political battle between tan boy and Mo, and that's it.\n\nSpeaker 2  30:13 Then it's gonna then, then this is our one shot to just put it right.\n\nSpeaker 1  30:18 I mean, they brought they like they brought me out.

I'd love to one\n\nSpeaker 3  30:42 thing, though, CPQ has a momentum for some data point that somebody found in some that we sell it to Webinar. No, no, we sell to cheap, for sure. But there's a reason we sell cheap as well, because we want to be sticky on billing, and we just throw CPQ as a flavour as a cherry. But the moment you say that I'm now, you're never available. Okay, I'm coming in two minutes. Never available. I'm always available. Just coming. So we sell CPQ for on an average, what Manfred says, $10 a seat. But if you want to go from 1020, to 50, people are going to say, Hey, do you do approvals? And we're gonna say, Yeah, we rely on sales forces approval. The questions come striking down. I fundamentally believe we can double our car, double our pricing. We can make 8 million more dollars from CPQ. You can't go to 60, $70 a seat in CPQ. You need to be better. You need to be doing configuration in there. We don't freaking even have a C, we only have p and q and B. Is also very much reliant on the back end. But where was going with this? In a webinar, somebody mentioned Salesforce legacy has 7000 or 8000 customers, out of which most of the customers are going to leave Salesforce ecosystem. Almost. The idea was more than 40% customers will leave Salesforce ecosystem. So that's a huge opportunity to catch them. Not 7700 something like that. Whatever that number was, I forgot, but the idea was we got a huge opportunity for Zora to go in and say, even if you get 10 20% of that, we got a lot many customers. That is what drove that. We got to have a very good CPQ. That's why I wrote next gen CPQ thingy, or next generation of CPQ thing and all. So that could be one thing that tomorrow gets raised and say, Oh, CPQ is still very important. I'm not saying it is not important, but have we validated our sales team says that I can't sell CPQ, so I feel we're not losing any time in delivering CPQ by going down, because\n\nSpeaker 2  32:44 this is the CPQ is implicit up here exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1  32:47 That's the other, I think what you just said, like so and over the past, so I've, this will be my sixth off site. And right, like, over the past, we talked about catalogue, well, boom, check, we delivered it. You know, we then talked about CPQ check, that team's delivering it. Now we're moving forward with the next phase of this, this element, and it's a progression of the unified strategy. And no one feels like their baby is being thrown out with the bath water. Everyone's happy. Nothing's going to get done as a result of this, this is literally. Sorry, I shouldn't say that. This is.\n\nSpeaker 1  33:52 Came in from Adobe, because, like, at Adobe, we have these meetings, and it's like, you're we're not going to do that. The next day, the decision is made, and it's and then, like we used to use the doc variant of the dot collection method that I introduced, where I'm like, every decision is logged and who voted on it, and then you go back and you repeatedly say, Oh, look, you voted you. We look at the performance of votes and the performance of the business. Here we have it. We make a decision, and then nothing happens.\n\nSpeaker 2  34:24 Well, t",

It's not one thing that you're breaking BCS or experiences or orchestration. What it is is you're breaking at the very top of the right, at the roots, right, rather, right? So you break, you negotiate for Twilio, and you have to give up. This is a reality. Is a different reality, because what we tend to do is we say you're giving up this, because no one understands what that means. But if these things are all connected, right? They support this foundation. They support this. So if you don't want this, that's fine. Go off and do a Twilio deal, but you have to understand the implications of the decision\n\nSpeaker 3  35:21 that will happen anyway. What's going to happen is you will have a core team that will continue to deliver this, but billing team will be tasked to say, you deliver Twilio, and then they will submit PRs and catalogue.

I'm going to take this conversation and just enhance that. And then what I kind of think tomorrow is it will not change. So I'll do it tonight, and then early tomorrow morning, maybe we can all regroup for half an hour. And the way I would do is I'll go up and say, Listen, you know, this is something that Errol and I and nav have synthesised together. You know, there's a lot of the concepts, if you want to read any of the documentation this, you know, It all exists. But what I want to do is bring this together in the in through the lens of sales, go to market through the lens of omni channel, through the lens of sko so I want to talk about, I want to raise the stakes up here. This is why you're listening to this right now. And then I want to go through this. This will land right because this is what everybody wants, the hand off, from the c2 to the c1 and then I'll there's some more throughout your Lego blocks example, which I thought was really cool. So I've got all of that. And then I think what we do is I say, Listen, the way this is going to work is, I want to do this, but Errol, and now we're going to jump in.

I think I'm because I'm, you know, this is still relatively new for me.\n\nSpeaker 1  38:23 I guess from my perspective, we own the message. We own the delivery. We should, will be rewarded for crisp, clean delivery, instead of any hesitation, totally. So I don't want to come in and add cut like I'm happy to add minor colour,\n\nSpeaker 2  38:39 just don't let me go off piece. And also don't let me get caught out with saying something that I'm painting myself into a corner, right? So if I I kind of know where to pitch this, right? But I, but this is not a story I know super well. What I do know is what the sales organisation wants. That's where I'm going to start. And I also know that this lands with boon in his B to B complex world. It lands with Paulo in the 60% of his business that's not B to B complex. Mark gagne is all B to any so he wants the full spectrum. So if the sales org is behind it, and omni channel is a thing that the product organisation has wanted for a long time, and I use this term here, which is what Pete identifies with, then we just get insulated and we go off. And the thing is, what we also then need to do with a fast follow is, I need to go back to Satish and say, Listen, you know that thing everyone bought into. We need some RECs opening here. If you want to deliver this, we need wrecks to deliver it. If you don't want to deliver if you don't the wrecks to be opened up, then we have to push back any delivery of this, and that means you have to go to Kyle Christensen, not that Satish, and I enough for Sarah, he buys into this. But you know, if Moo says, Listen, there's no engineering resource, and that's a conversation between Kyle and move,\n\nSpeaker 1  40:06 that's going to be an interesting one to see. I mean, obviously he made the first move, so\n\nSpeaker 2  40:11 it's fine. That's That's why this is a but this might this, this, I love, right? I love this, because all of this is in, in your control. This whole section here,\n\nSpeaker 1  40:26 I'm with you. I i think the the one question I'm going to ask, right? I think we agree. So park this moment as we discussed last we ultimately want to get to a converse because that's what boon and everyone wants to sell. That's how we grow our side. You know, you're, you're the business you run, the businesses we run, substantially, right, and commerce will get, I mean, you've seen the model, right. So to get to commerce, I agree with this, but there's also some fundamental blocking and tackling that needs to be built out. Most notably, you know, we're doing packaging mer",

So we'll need, like, we could do very weak promotions, or we could do a real promotion engine, because that's what commerce is, that can interact with agents and other things. So at the end of the day, when we actually start identifying these domains, like, how are you thinking of staffing them and defining them.\n\nSpeaker 2  41:34 Well, I think it's so. I think so. My understanding is that promotion engine goes down here, right? Does it sit next to rules? Or where does it live in this?\n\nSpeaker 1  41:45 Well, it's a variation. It's it's a domain. That's why I said earlier with actions, are actions to domains so are they? Are actions, just an ACP, MCP layer that call from the that abstract away from the back end to get the difference?\n\nSpeaker 2  42:02 Yeah, I do. I think the, I think the the argument still lives up here, right? If you want to compete in omni channel, right? If you want to be truly omni channel then, and you're not doing full promotions, then you're not really delivering this. Are you? It's just a it's just, we're not best in class, yeah. Is that a fair summary or not? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  42:30 I mean, you can't have omni channel without package price promote, yeah, so I know that's so that's package price promote,\n\nUnknown Speaker  42:36 order, but that's the input, then right\n\nSpeaker 1  42:40 order as the verb that rolly created. But that would you have answered verb or doubt on that?\n\nSpeaker 4  42:47 I actually, I was thinking verb only because that's how the order is placed, and things are pulled in, and then it leads to subscription\n\nSpeaker 2  42:56 and all right, yeah, but you see that, think about the argument, right? Instead of talking about promotions, we talk about the customer experience up here. So we say, Listen, you can't have omni channel, which, because you can't, you're not. We've built a fragile promotions product, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  43:23 We don't have a promotions, we have a discounting. That's but\n\nSpeaker 2  43:26 let's say we built we build it.

We don't have some so which means that when we go to market with it up here, we're not really delivering this thing. Because when the customer goes, well, have you got, you know, promotions that they go on? Not really well. They go well, that we don't have this that doesn't exist. Then if you can't get to the last mile. So I would argue that we approach the the the question of Rex, around the delivery of the of this as a first class experience. I do get a feeling that ACP MCP is one of those things you wouldn't get support for. So the staffing, I think it has to be an incremental build, which is, we're going to deliver that thing, we're going to get it to market, we're going to we're going to establish presence, we're going to show what true omni channel means. And then we need more resource in order, or the same resource in order, to deliver an agentic first system. Now if the agentic first is 2027 or, sorry, 28 then we're out of the game, right? So it has to be 27 but when in 27\n\nSpeaker 1  44:42 so I and I agree, I just feel like and we're saying the same thing. I think, you know,",

It's like a co so we have package, price and promote, and within package, it's packaging and merchandising. These need to be like, first class, best, best in class, and then pulling not only from our catalogue, but any MDM, any cat, that's where I'm going, right? So like, if you view commerce foundation as that true abstraction layer and intelligence, you can almost start thinking about it very It doesn't have to be the old school domain. It could be a lightweight domain built for like, the future. Instead of having all of these rigid processes, you get the difference. It's a nuance, but it's like, so hey, we're not your MDM, we're your commerce found subscription optimization platform.\n\nSpeaker 2  45:51 Yeah, I agree. I agree, in principle, and what you're saying, in order to deliver\n\nUnknown Speaker  45:58\n\nthat this price package,\n\nSpeaker 2  46:02 package, price and promote. So that's the pricing,\n\nUnknown Speaker  46:07 pricing engine, right? The pricing rules,\n\nSpeaker 1  46:09 we have pricing today, but then packaging is different, and promotion will be different,\n\nSpeaker 2  46:14 all right, so packaging, promotion and pricing are domains, and then slash business processes under Actions that deliver the experience.\n\nUnknown Speaker  46:25 Yes, right, okay, the one\n\nSpeaker 2  46:27 thing because that, but where does rules is not a domain.\n\nSpeaker 1  46:30 Then rules is like, it's a supporting, it's a foundation, okay? So I would say the one thing that is missing by intentional omission at this point is going to be order, and order is cart, checkout, yeah, and I think we, we don't like, if we're asked as a unifying statement, we should say, you know, we'll, we'll provide high performance checkout, but the order object will continue to stay in Zora. We can deal with that later, but I don't if and if nav says different, like, we should coach nav, because we've been down this path and we're set up for failure. It's just it's just too tightly coupled, and it's too protected.\n\nSpeaker 2  47:18 How just a complete adjacent question, how attached to that is, conceptually, the payments work that Ken is doing, is there any connection between the checkout, the not the order, but the checkout and the payments\n\nSpeaker 1  47:34 product eventually, yes, so maybe that's the maybe that's the join we when we bring checkout, like, what we need is best in class, checkout with tax fraud, you know, address verification, like all of that other stuff. All Ken does is, like, it's a payment form, but what Jimmy will get us is by August, is the rest of that checkout flow, and it's super easy,\n\nUnknown Speaker  48:03 all hooked up into the\n\nUnknown Speaker  48:06\n\nBilling APIs, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  48:07 Yeah, we basically just do what, like fast and bolt have done, like, you know, what,\n\nSpeaker 2  48:14 a bowl, yeah. Like, we built, we rebuilt bolt for sub\n\nSpeaker 1  48:18 x, yeah, super easy. Yeah, it was in this day and age. You know,\n\nSpeaker 2  48:22 we've almost carbon copy. Great.

Then that's where you and now we're going to be able to really\n\nSpeaker 1  50:21 help me. What would be good, in my opinion, is for the entire room to see commerce is a $13 billion opportunity. Key, light is competing. Le Mayo sucks. Our customers want this. And number one, we're all part of Zora. So the success of commerce Foundation, just like payments and others like it's in your everyone in this room, it is in your interest to climb out of your silo and help us? Yeah, totally, but if you could figure out how to get that message to us. So that's number one. And then number two is, is what Shakir has been working on, like get everyone by getting everyone bought in. Then the two things, catalogue was very destruct disruptive to you, good news, Promotions and these other elements are going to be a lot easier, but we need you to, you know, jump into the jump, you know, under the train with us. And if you do that, that's the win.\n\nSpeaker 2  51:24 Yeah, well, it, to be honest with you, I think I almost I take that rather than ask for it, right? This is the strategy, right? Like just coming back to the same thing, that's what that's the pay master up there. The pay master wants this, which deliver is delivered by this. So we're taking that. We're not asking for it. So maybe it's just a difference of\n\nSpeaker 1  51:49 so you're not going to talk tab, you're going to say, this is what sales before?\n\nSpeaker 2  51:53 And that's Boone, DJ, Baptista.

You can give credit and say, well, it's the same thing that we've been doing, but we are just adding a little bit of flavour. In my experience at Zora, have learned this, even if you do something new, you tell people that, hey, I'm not changing anything, but I'm taking and evolving. That works very well with people. If you say that actually we should be doing something new, you will have people on defence.\n\nSpeaker 1  2:33 So what are we? What is our pitch? Then that we are taking a first principles approach, or we're taking an architecture led approach, and we're going to do these series. The proposal is, we do this series of things. We are\n\nSpeaker 2  2:45 still taking outcome based approach. What is the outcome that we need? The outcome is number one, that we got. Stage one, stage two, stage three. We are not saying, because in the past, we have had discussion that we need a seed addition or something. We are not saying, Let's build a seed edition. We're saying, Let's build what we want to build in a way that we can build architecturally. We can compose anything and everything for stage one and stage two out of this. Now, of course, there will be compromises. That is what we're working through it. But while building what we want to build, we do it a compose in a manner that it is composable, and hence we can build it, not only that, that allows us to really, in effect, deliver which something truly only channel commerce. How does it do that? Because when you extract and abstract the components that are going to sit across the board, and you don't develop it within individual teams, you bring it down into the intersection whatever you call the bottom most layer, which is where the true architectural principles come in. Then ultimately, the actions and interactions are facilitated by your by your L zero or l1 layers, the top most layers, but they are executed in the code, in the same engine. That always gets hit when my core is the same, compliance is through the same when the rules and everything are getting executed in the same engine, I know the decision making will remain same regardless of which interaction you execute from wherever. Channel agnostic\n\nSpeaker 1  4:16 and what you're sorry just to interpret that, what you're saying is that today, because there is not that intersection.

That CPQ uses its own set of rules, right? Catalogue doesn't have its any any rules. We need to right now, currently, we need to pull it out and then put it there. Second, I cannot.\n\nSpeaker 1  4:59 Need to, sorry, I don't. Can you just expand on what a unified rules engine does, besides delivering true omni channel, which is that I know that my experience is consistent wherever I place. It not only that,\n\nSpeaker 2  5:14 it just doesn't need you as a user to craft the rules at multiple places. Okay? I don't need to anymore, yeah, and it helps you to visualise which rules will be conflicting and whatnot. It just makes the experience so easy.\n\nSpeaker 1  5:28 And are the rules universal enough that a single rules engine caters for those two use cases, regardless\n\nSpeaker 2  5:37 of them being universal enough, I think they should be in one place. Why? Because when I build CPQ rules, I may have rules that are not my common merchandising rules, for the lack of a better word, why? Because they may be very much specific to my B to B, segment X, Y, Z, for a customer that has ACB of 100 million. But there's nothing to say that I cannot pull it out and put it in my core rules. Right? One can argue that you won't execute it in your plg flow, or you won't execute it in your self service flow, because nobody, for ACV, 100 million is ever going to go\n\nSpeaker 1  6:15 through that flow. So that goes 100% sales assisted, exactly\n\nSpeaker 2  6:19 sure, but doesn't mean that for my rule management, I should go to two windows correct two different systems. I should go in one system. And what happens with that is, whilst that guy, or the 100 million ACB guy, has one specific rule for that guy, for that scenario, but that guy will need 10 other rules from here that are still the same. The product compatibility rules being one example, the bundling rules could be another example. So I need to build those things here, and it is very easy when I have to visualise rules. My ultimate vision is I should be able to visualise your guardrails in such a way that I'm not bound to a root entity. What do I mean by that? I want to visualise the whole rule and constraint chain and the graph from a product perspective at the same time, I want to visualise it from a user's context perspective. You are a B to B guy who's ACB this and this, what is your rule graph and all that\n\nSpeaker 1  7:24 your rules? You want your rules to represent the true use cases, yes, for which you're designing them.\n\nSpeaker 2  7:29 Yes, right? And and the interconnection and the dependencies of the rules also, I want to visualise because if I want to create something, I don't want to wait for execution and say these two are conflicting.\n\nSpeaker 1  7:39 And would you say that having, if I have both sales assisted and self serve, that that having visibility in a single place of both sets of rules is a minimum viable requirement? There is no justification for two rules engines. So my question is, why are we building multiple Rules Engines?\n\nSpeaker 2  8:07 I don't think so we so we have to, right now. We got pricing rule engine out there, and we got CPQ having their own rule engine and the legacy.\n\nSpeaker 1  8:17 Okay, so they, they're one is new, one is legacy, yes.\n\nSpeaker 2  8:21 So pricing rule engine, I know is only pricing rule engine, because I know it will be limited when we do multiple products and all those things in there. So we need to come up with something that works for everybody. We have experimented with some things, rules being one, but I think we need to invest a littl",

There are people who say that there are systems out there that we can just take and white label or, you know, use the libraries and all. I know there are multiple options, but I also want to do a research based on where this whole rule and constraint market is going to go.\n\nSpeaker 1  8:55 Okay, so what you're saying is that the omni channel is the goal\n\nSpeaker 2  9:02 is definitely goal, along with their unlocking stage one and stage two, yes, composability,\n\nSpeaker 1  9:10 composability and the one, one. Principle number one is rules.\n\nUnknown Speaker  9:15 Rules are in four parts. I\n\nSpeaker 2  9:17 won't say that way. I would say principle number one is, do not do one job at more than one places.\n\nSpeaker 1  9:23 Yeah, that that's like a foot that's Yeah, I agree with that. Well, I guess what I meant was, yes, I agree 100% what I meant it doesn't make any sense either. What I meant was, is that the in order to achieve omni channel and stage one and stage two, for which we make the case that there is a bigger consumer of that our go to market teams. And I also spoke to Darren Johnson just now, and he affirmed that he's got large FinTech companies who are B to B, plg, 253, 400 million, that they that plg is their motion sales assisted is not their motion. So what you're saying, though, is that in order to achieve omni channel intersection, one of the intersections is a common rules engine,\n\nSpeaker 2  10:11 which is what we call compliance last night. So rules and price waterfall, all they sits\n\nSpeaker 1  10:16 together for me, what would you say? What would you call it? Because I want to be precise in our rules, rules, compliance,\n\nSpeaker 2  10:22 price, waterfall, yeah, compliance just fits together. But the other pieces that I believe are have to be same as the flow orchestration that we're calling find a better name for it.\n\nSpeaker 1  10:33 But is that part of the rules, or is that everything orchestration is different? Okay, so what I want to be clear on is there are going to be some. So we're saying, listen, Omni channel\n\nUnknown Speaker  10:42\n\nequals, excuse me.\n\nSpeaker 1  10:45 In fact, let me. Let me ask you, what does omni channel mean to you? Because I've heard slightly different versions of this. Okay, is it just being able to sell wherever the customers? No, no, no,\n\nSpeaker 2  11:01 that is not only channel. That is multi channel, right? So for me, Omni channel means that one you can sell from anywhere but making sure I can carry forward the transaction that I started in one channel in another channel, without any loss. Okay, so it's a seamless experience, whether I am in one channel, second channel or third channel. So for example, I may be in the self service when I go and I say, You know what? Let me just ask for assistance. I'm gonna call click the button, yeah, and then you're on the phone. That pop ups the exactly same thing that you were doing in front of a sales rep. And you just pick up from there. You don't explain anything easy the person can impersonate or the person can execute. They can have larger permission set for you. But that's to me, what omni channel is, which also means the type of actions that you can execute behind each of those have to be powered by the same things it cannot be you can do. Of course,\n\nSpeaker 1  12:03 you can one thing in one channel, a different thing, another channel. So I to me the setup of rules, compliance, whatever else we put into that bucket. The customer use case is from the utility, right? I just want to do one thing in one place that makes sense to me, the omni channel. Hand off to me again. These may be naive questions, but the rules are already baked. So are you. So what you're saying is that if, if it if, if it was possible, that I could be in this environment, which is my self serve, but then I am also have a sales rep in this in the sales assisted, if I was t",

I should be able to pick it up. I should be able to say, refresh the session, and I should be able to take from the last committed point, from wherever,\n\nSpeaker 1  13:05 and therefore, just as a pattern, having rules in one place. Because how let me, let me just think about this, the self. So at the moment, are you saying that if rules were in catalogue, rules engine in the sales assisted existed, doesn't\n\nSpeaker 2  13:22 matter if it is in catalogue or anywhere. If we have two set of rules, it's definitely going\n\nSpeaker 1  13:27 to be a problem. 100% agree with no, no. I agree with that. But what you're saying is, is that what could happen is I've got a self serve configuration in front of me, and yeah, and then I have two different and then I'm over in the CPQ product, and that's just slightly different rules to this over here. In fact, I maybe I got the rules wrong in different environments right. So rules is the substrate to omni channel, one of one of the things I'm gonna get to there. So the journey is I go from a self serve to hit the button I need to speak to a sales rep, unified set of rules to two different channels. One is the website, one is internal portal, and we're good to go. That's omni channel delivered by single observers. Okay, that's number one\n\nSpeaker 2  14:18 in one sentence. Basically, Omni channel is, regardless of you having N channels every your entire set of your entire surface area of channels behaves as one channel, correct?\n\nSpeaker 1  14:27 That's what it is. It seems to me entirely obvious that then you would want one intersection. You do understand what\n\nUnknown Speaker  14:34 is one thing, what's the other thing? So\n\nSpeaker 2  14:36 you cannot not have a single context manager on top of it, which is where bcsr intelligent context management comes in. And the third,\n\nSpeaker 1  14:45 still, sorry, I don't mean to. I just want to go back, because I'm going to tee this up, and I want you to add some flavour. I thought Errol was at zag tomorrow, so I'm not sure how he's going to fit into this, but I can talk to him about that if you think about intelligent context manager. Let's talk about omni channel again, right? So, how does context resolve? How does a single I mean, the principle is, single, yes, 100% but actuality is, how does a single context manager resolve the omni channel?\n\nSpeaker 2  15:19 Because you pick up a session. So you have a session, you anchor at that session, and you say, I want to resume that session. Okay, if you have ever, there are systems. I think Amazon does this as well. You are doing. You're making shopping. It can ask you, Hey, which one do you want to pick? Not Amazon. I have seen this. Like, there are multiple sessions you started. It will it will prompt you when you go to some other page or website or Safari or something else. Hey, I see these things in there. Do you want to start resume? Any of these insurance companies do that as well? Like, that's when you are, when you're calling progress auto insurance companies, and you hang up, or you're doing something on the web, and they hang up, and then you call them. They're like, Hey, I see that you have tried two codes over here. Do you want me to pick up one of those?\n\nSpeaker 1  16:08 Okay, sorry, can we just index on that? Right? Because I think the story that we tell is, listen omni channel. Let's give you, let's give you a picture of what we're talking about in omni channel today. Omni channel is we start off at self serve, and it progresses very quickly into sales assisted. But it's just keep that lens, because that's omni channel you can and out into whatever environment, right? So we've, we've we've established What rules do the session and the context of the session. So how rich does the context need to be? Context can be anything right? So you could argue that you don't have to define what th",

If I had tried three quotes, then the sales assisted motion has to understand that I have three quotes. And therefore it has to understand the context, your context, whatever that is, is relevant to the sales assisted\n\nSpeaker 2  17:13 Yes, right. Okay. I do not need to tell you that. Hey, I actually logged in from Georgia. I mean, when I log into that, I know I can pick up the same context and work as if that guy was working away that user was directly working. It may so happen that I, as a service sales rep, have elevated set of permissions. I can do some things that that person cannot. I can see something that that person, which is where comes, you know, interaction, flow and everything based on permission, about can you see? What can you not see? But yes, context management has to be unified up at the\n\nUnknown Speaker  17:46\n\ntop. And there's\n\nSpeaker 1  17:47 also the persistence of something that you do, which is context right now, you know, I'm picking I left, I went away, I logged out, I come back in, I you know, myself, yeah, it's a\n\nSpeaker 2  17:58 whole box. So I can actually argue that whatever you did, I keep on persisting into a dynamo and then what I do is, the moment you come to CPQ, you give me a call, and I say, what's your customer ID? This is your customer ID. Go in there, and I see DynamoDB Pull what is the most recent sessions from DynamoDB? I can show it. That's exactly how persistence is needed. Yeah. Session is persistence, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  18:19 So, so context allows a single context, intelligent context orchestrator, is that the intelligent bit, because that, you know, that seems to be like session persistence doesn't feel to me. No, that's to be a context orchestrator, the\n\nSpeaker 2  18:37 in context not It's not context orchestrator, it's context orchestrator. It's context manager, where I think the intelligence piece is going to come from. I know what interaction you are executing. I can tell you the context can have the sun and the moon and the earth and all the planets, but you don't need it. All you need is just some terrestrial information that I know what you need based on the interaction you're trying to carry out. That's where the intelligence has to be given into this, that if you're doing product browsing, I don't need maybe five other things, but if you are checking out, or if you are trying to look for discounts, I need to look at what kind of entitlements you have. So what those kind of smartness we need to add right now, yes.\n\nUnknown Speaker  19:22 So what you're saying is that the context\n\nSpeaker 1  19:25 is a point, and that there could be other things around the context,\n\nSpeaker 2  19:34 to be honest. Sorry, it's a kind of a data cloud. That's how I visualise it, and you don't that\n\nUnknown Speaker  19:38\n\nintelligence doesn't even exist.\n\nSpeaker 1  19:40 I mean, when I know we haven't built it, right? So what we have today is we have versions of a rules engine. We have a a context service which is dumb, right? And we have entitlements which is static, not some, right? Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean that you're right. Dumb is a bad word, but static, static context service that, and then zems, which is at the kind of par with that, right? It's not,\n\nSpeaker 2  20:06 it's a fairly serious, both BCS and zems are infants,\n\nUnknown Speaker  20:09 right now, yeah, zems is, is or is not.\n\nSpeaker 1  20:12 I mean, presumably zems is an enabler for omni channel as well, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  20:16 Yeah, 100% Yeah. So that is a component you can it's more southbound xems comes after you have checked out. So because the\n\nSpeaker 1  20:27 account is created, yes, but then it's relevant at the access, the renewal, or at the content, subsequent contract negotiation or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2  20:36 You can challenge it.

Where do you see identity, like the individual identity? At the moment, I hear, you know, we have an account in Zephyr. We have an identity. I can attach one, one identity to N accounts. Yes, identity is or is not a substrate\n\nSpeaker 2  21:03 to reaching to have that it is. This is where I was going, that identity and session management. Should I merge context management with that? Because seems like it should know the identity. So that's what my brain is right now. But we do. We got to do the pros and cons. Where does it sit? It should be a new service, not attached to Zora account. It can have a relationship with Zora accounts, which it needs to but I believe it. I I believe there is value in evolving context service into becoming identity and context management.\n\nSpeaker 1  21:39 Can I ask you identity in the context of Zephyr is we have identity. We control the grant and the entitlement that the entitlement which creates a grant to the user, right? So like you have access to this content in the B to B space, we're not. We're not the arbiter of access. We are the army feels like a leap, if, like, if I'm a $250 million FinTech company. I know, you know, I've got loads of systems that say I'm logging in and you're that person. It feels to me that what we what we that identity, is part of context, a customer ID, but I don't think we're going to be granting the access to the usage. We will we return. We're not provisioning we return. We say, Listen, give me the identity, because the identity resolves into context, and context is a centralised service that helps you do true omni channel.\n\nSpeaker 2  22:40 If you're going to that level of identity, then I agree that we are not the right ones, but we need identity associated with Zora account to highlight the context correct.\n\nSpeaker 1  22:51 So we do need some relationship with identity. At the moment, the only place that we understand identity is in Zephyr. So that is part of you. You would, how would you? Would you put a question mark identity? How would you? How would you connect this story our rules? Feels very precise. Yeah, context feels very precise. Identity is what an open question about the role of identity, but context and identity, let\n\nSpeaker 2  23:19 me see exactly what data Zephyr stores as well in this and what are the flows that Zephyr executes, then I can give you a precise but from the knowledge that I have right now, I personally believe I can. I still believe I can evolve BCS into a new service which takes on both the roles and says I'm identity and context management instead of intelligent context management.\n\nSpeaker 1  23:42 That's Errol, that's arrows in your CDP kind of thing in that, in order to have,\n\nSpeaker 2  23:46 I mean, not CDP, but yeah, you know, that's similar, yeah, actually. Because why he's saying CDP is because this is exactly what I told him as well. At that time I drew it up as well. Yeah, that it's not one element, session and identity becomes a subset of context. Yeah, correct. But it's possible that I don't I do. I'm not the owner of identity, but I capture it.\n\nSpeaker 1  24:05 You need a better, better word, the CDP, like we discussed, yeah? So my question is, so what I know about our identity and Zephyr is it's not monetization, Data Cloud monetization, yeah, yeah, that's good. MDC, yeah, we would probably have to buy. I spoke to Alan about identity, and he said, if you're going to do identity at this scale, you buy key cloud or key cloak or whatever. You know,\n\nSpeaker 2  24:31 that's exactly what we discussed. Yeah, I'm not saying we will do it. Okay, yeah, I think\n\nSpeaker 1  24:36 so we've got, we've got the story of omni channel, we've got rules, we've got context, and then we had actions.

That outcome is generally an action or something like or a set of tasks that I have to perform. If action isn't the right word, what is that right word? Whatever that is, it's a composition of steps. If there's a composition of steps, I may have some decision making in there. May have some back and forth in there, some back and forth may be very much channel specific or persona specific. How do I create that whole thing so that it is transferable from one channel to the other, but it is there? I know that my customer, which is zoom, won't have to stitch it together. You can customise it.\n\nSpeaker 1  25:42 But given given the con, given the rule and the context, an action is taken that delivers my om channel experience, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  25:53 Given a context and interaction, we execute an action that may lead to some rules getting executed, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  26:00 Okay, so at the top of this, this whole idea of interactions and experiences, right? So experiences is both the interaction layer and the act and the post action layer, right? Or, or is, in fact, the action looping back in it to the interaction. Yeah. So the experience is, how do the different personas enter? Whatever? Yeah, the interactions inform. So the intent, but the rule, what I'm, what I'm, the rules are driving. The in the interactions are driving the rules. The the rules get the customer to a state, to a point in time, the context is capturing the session this, you know, yeah, where that customer is at that point in time, from entitlements, everything else, yeah, and then, and then, and then, what that achieves is omni channel, because you have a point in time that has a front end representation that can be consumed differently by different channels. Yes, that's\n\nSpeaker 2  27:15 I see one thing that you were just saying, then I started thinking, you're right. Maybe I can reduce action to action is the ultimate thing that gets executed, or a set of things that get executed. I don't have to overload actions with rules, because technically, rules probably have been executed before that already. One thing we can refine is, I believe right at the time the action is taken, I may have to execute some more rules, like deciding whether or not it goes to approval. That may have to be somewhere down there, but that's like splitting here, and that's too much detail for the audience you're going to have here. Yes, we have to work through it and then perfect decomposition of these things, okay, but conceptually, yes, that's the direction.\n\nSpeaker 1  27:59 So the story changes slightly, because what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, Listen, let's begin with the customer. What is the vision of omnichannel? We tell the we tell that story through the stage one, stage two, stage three. I do a little bit of framing of how this gives us the slider from cells assisted to self serve or sell, the other way around. I then go into a little bit of detail that effectively translates what you and I have just spoken about. Then what I want to do is I suspect the question on everyone's mind is going to be, how are you going to execute this, right? Like, how is this going to get done? Now, Shakir said to me, listen, he made the point, because you own it loosely, own it. You should be able to control it, right? So it's the point that you made, which is, this is what I've always wanted to do. No one actually owned it, and therefore no one controlled it. And therefore we now own it and control it collectively, and we can get this thing done. So I wonder what is on the table at that point in the presentation? Is it? Well, tell me about the context.

He's not.\n\nUnknown Speaker  31:31 The moment pricing comes or pricing model comes, he's like,\n\nSpeaker 1  31:34 no and but the pricing you say, the pricing model, rolls up into this larger rules engine, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  31:41 Not pricing models. Pricing model is one thing that sits across the board. I think the monetization through the catalogue should own the modelling piece. How the model gets executed, could be through rules or could be through hard coded algorithm that I have to there would be hard coded algorithm. There's a whole piece on pricing that I've written, because I believe the core of the pricing has never changed per unit flat fee. Lot. That's it. You keep on putting multiple models on top of it, and then you keep on getting more and more and more abstractions out of it and saying, oh, I should have commitment with consumption. I should have outcome, whatever. That is, a completely different set of thinking on that space, and that goes again to a different tangent. CPQ needs it. Catalogue needs it, but you also need billing and revenue to be able to reason about it and show the data that comes out of it.\n\nSpeaker 1  32:38 Got it? Okay? So what you're saying is it's an it's a service that's required, but it doesn't directly support the omni channel story. We can be only John\n\nSpeaker 2  32:48 doesn't care about it. Doesn't care, yeah, Omni channel cares about the higher level construct. And say, I got a product, how do I price it? It's a completely different\n\nUnknown Speaker  32:56 abstraction. Who's driving pricing there?\n\nSpeaker 2  32:59 Nobody, nobody was supposed to be catalogued and drives it. But invariably, what has happened? Now, I used to be passionate and drive it, but Twilio and trade web had pricing requirements, which came to err and arrow was like, I don't want to do it like this. I want to do it through rules. Not everything can be done with rules, because there are multiple constructs that come along and build an assembly. So Errol kind of said, I have my own roadmap, so billing tea",

    "content": " just took it on themselves and they started doing it. So right now, billing team is pushing ahead with some concepts of their shipping, like commitment and all. I believe that model needs to change. I believe we got to have, just like we have commerce, CPQ, intersection, we got to have a pricing team that lets billing team know and reading team know and revenue team know, and similarly, catalogue, hey, this is the assembly. Catalogue will render it this way. CPP will use it this way. Revenue will interpret it this way. Billing will output the invoice like this. That pricing has to be a piece that is much bigger intersection, not just for commerce, for Zora, so,\n\nSpeaker 1  34:03 so talking about the intersection, if CPQ and catalogue are the consumers of a much bigger intersection that does that, then I mean, Could you, could You deliver omni channel without pricing? You can right? So who would but? But if pricing is foundational, how do you how do you deliver CPQ and catalogue without pricing?\n\nSpeaker 2  34:32 It's not that you won't have pricing. You will have pricing. The issue is going to be the abstractions have to be built in a way that tomorrow I have a new pricing model. I don't have a chain, CPQ and catalogue and everything in commerce experience is it just somehow I know the DSL such that that you give me this, I'll render it not a problem. It is not a fundamental redesign. If that happens, then we can deliver it. So only channel already will deliver pricing like flat fee per unit discounts and\n\nSpeaker 1  35:01 all those. Where does that live now? In the catalogue or pricing? Yeah, in catalogue. In catalogue, yeah, so you could say so. And because CPQ uses catalogue, it's using the pricing that's already baked in right now, yes, so maybe that's one of those things that we don't raise.\n\nSpeaker 2  35:19 I think you me and Ken probably need to sit together. We can\n\nSpeaker 1  35:21 do a battle later. Yeah, got an offline Yeah? Because if you do that, then it kind of explodes out,\n\nSpeaker 2  35:26 yeah, because that ecosystem is much more complicated. Yes, you've got catalogue over here right now. Catalogue says pricing needs to be defined here. Pricing models need to be defined here, but then CPQ uses catalogue, hence it gets pricing, but pricing says I need to talk to a pricing engine, without pricing engine, which is basically where the logic sits, yeah, okay, I cannot do anything. And similarly, there would be a discount engine, and then billing says that when I execute it, because I read something called a subscription, which is the manifested cart. This guy also goes to pricing engine, and then I get the information. And then down here is my friends in revenue, they need this, and they\n\nSpeaker 1  36:19 need this. Yeah, I can see all of that, right? That makes perfect sense. It's pretty Yeah, if you're gonna have something that touches so many different systems, it has to be SB, one thing. It has to be one thing. But then that doesn't negate the idea of having a, you know, simple pricing rules in the catalogue, because the pricing engine can consume, right? Yeah, that's\n\nSpeaker 2  36:41 exactly what I did. Yeah, the dining pricing, the way I did it was on this concept. Only what I did, let this be the oldest, be this. So I'm going to extract this out and say I'm building a db which is actually powered by something beneath the surface, which is rules. I can change it any day, rules and constraints. I can remove it. I can add a new one. Nobody cares. But this stays Yes, but this guy knows I haven't talked to this guy always, and this guy returns something. So basically all this ecosystem can stay the same, yeah, and this abstraction is what was an architectural concept that I wanted to put out. Now what I can do is this whole this thing, ultimately, one day, if we can, I'm telling you this. I want to tell Ken this as well. If we can set this thing up as a core team, then I would want to take this architectural concept and blow it up and say, This is our mone",

But yeah, anyway, this is\n\nSpeaker 1  37:51 okay, so that's very interesting. So if we, if we then circle all the way back, we have we start with omni channel, we move into experiences and interactions. Interactions, in your mind is, is, is anything right, anything that the customer needs to do through an experience, to build a self serve experience, or a sales assisted or an internal assisted view, it's whatever it is, right? Okay, so those are, those are our experiences.\n\nSpeaker 2  38:23 By the way, Errol and I have discussed this term, and he buys this.\n\nSpeaker 1  38:27 Yeah, alright, so omni channel. The next layer is the experience, the next layer is the interaction. The next layer is the context. The next layer is the is the right, then,\n\nUnknown Speaker  38:41 no, they tell you, orchestration, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 1  38:43 interactions, no, there's context, experience and the orchestration, the the bunch of actions, basically, what are we calling that intelligent orchestra? Is the actions the intelligent No, there was sorry, I'm getting all over the place because I'm tired, but, well, I was on context orchestrated. But we had something before that, not\n\nSpeaker 2  39:02 context, commerce or commerce. So the that's the\n\nUnknown Speaker  39:06 bit I'm not sure of. How do those and actions connect up\n\nSpeaker 2  39:09 with each other? That is the guy that executes the action case, right? So it is basically called\n\nSpeaker 1  39:13 that as so it's one block, yeah. One is, I've got the content, I've got the interaction, the context,\n\nUnknown Speaker  39:21 and I and I have the\n\nSpeaker 1  39:24 execution of the action, right? Yeah, it does that. So I understand that orchestration, orchestration of that, yeah, and the outcome of an action to you loops all the way back to the front end. Experience the state, the persistence, is captured in the context. That's omni channel, right? And the\n\nSpeaker 2  39:44 outcome, although is persisted in wherever it has to be persisted in commerce system, yeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1  39:49 And what we are effectively saying is that if you want a true omni channel experience, we have to focus on the intersections as a roadmap, yes, otherwise, we will not deliver omni channel. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2  40:01 And secondly, if we want to focus on building this in a way so that we can have referenceable architecture and composable, I think the word composable would hit home. So then these pieces are even more important.\n\nSpeaker 1  40:15 So in your I'm always cautious about labels, but in your mind, composable architecture means exactly what it's\n\nSpeaker 2  40:27 very simple, to be honest, all I all I care about not talking about execution is in your application or suite of applications, I got bunch of functions that I can perform, but I don't need To perform all of those to get to an outcome. I can pick and choose what I want. And if your system, and I love the Lego block analogy all the time, because it works for me in my head, in your system, if I have to assemble 100 Lego blocks to build your entire system, I may want only a fragment of that, and I can compose that fragment for myself, because that's all I need for my business, which is why it will it should work for stage one, stage two and stage three. Stage three needs the whole thing. Stage two needs probably 60% of that. And different stage two customers may need different 60% that can only happen if you do composited. Can I just\n\nUnknown Speaker  41:19 draw something? I know we've got 10 minutes. So if we, if we\n\nSpeaker 1  41:28 assume omni channel is up here, and we also assume that there is a sales self serve and sales assisted, right? Well, I mean, it's not directly, but there's, like, you can have any point, yeah, it's a spectrum. It has to be a spectrum. So that's a spectrum. So this is our, this is our Omni and this is our sales motion here, right? Then, in order for that to wor",

You have context, service, you have orchestrator, you have actions, right? And then, actually, there's that doesn't exist that last bit, and then this loops back on itself, right? So the story really is that if you want to have this layer, sorry, if you want to have this layer, you need to have this layer, these, these in themselves, also have\n\nSpeaker 2  42:41 combinations, yeah, components. Now one can argue that this is exactly actually, yeah, thank you for putting it this way. This is really cool. In my head. I was still drawing Lego blocks, but this makes it very simple to understand and visualise. So let's talk about, maybe experiences. What kind of experiences we're talking about? You got product display pages here? Yeah, so product display pages. You got a cart as an experience. You got a price guidance, maybe a widget. Similarly, they could be my account widget. But when I look at this guy, or this guy actually, I would see that these things, a few of these would be needed in everywhere in the spectrum, in different shape we are formed. So that is why, when I break it down here, let's say this guy has bunch of stuff, stuff in there, whatever this is, what I need to do is this whole experience, layer, interaction, layer, this stays the same, and I carry it forward, but the only thing that will change is at this point, only this, this and this is lighting up over here, there would be more that are lighting up and are used and are interconnected, because\n\nSpeaker 1  43:52 one is a self serve and one is a sales assistant. Yes. So this, and this is driven by\n\nUnknown Speaker  44:02\n\nyour contact, context, yes,\n\nSpeaker 1  44:05 orchestration and actions, right? No.\n\nSpeaker 2  44:09 Orchestration, action will not drive that, right, right? I think context will drive what you\n\nSpeaker 1  44:13 see, yeah, but then the orchestration, all right, let's see you're right. So what happens? Sorry, are you right? That's mine. So what you've got is BCS drives Grace Yes, which is omni channel, yes, right, yes. And underneath the actions that the orchestration and the actions that are taken here, and the orchestration and the actions that taken here are all controlled by the same correct the same thing, exactly. So in order to deliver omni channel, yeah, you have to be able to control out omni channel. You have to be able to control omni channel, yes, which means you need unified concepts, which means you intersection as a roadmap, which means, etc,\n\nSpeaker 2  45:05 so all these components, this is why architecture is important, because how do I not do this in a way that over here is completely different and reused? Because not only that, there is an underlying engineering philosophy behind it. Because if I want to do that, then actually I'm doubling up my work. It will delay the roadmap. So you are actually helping Errol and Manfred to deliver the roadmap faster as well,\n\nSpeaker 1  45:28 because they because, because over here, because over here, catalogue and CPQ are orchestrating, are the substrate to those experiences?\n\nSpeaker 2  45:44 Yeah, 100% and even I would say, and I don't want to say that in the public billing as well, yeah. I mean, although I don't care that much, because we're not going to touch billing one day, we will have to touch pricing. But I think too many battles at once is not going\n\nSpeaker 1  45:58 to the way I'm going to do this is I'm going to change the deck a little bit, quite a lot. I'm going to build this pattern slowly. This is the story. I build this map. And on the start there, the end map will be this. And what I want to do is, then, at each point, say, Listen, why do we want sales assist, self service and sales assisted, right? Well, we want omni channel, but we also have sales teams that want to sell along the spectrum, correct, right? In order to do that intersection. So here's the motivation for intersection. Intersection has to be",

And then we've also got this kind of other motion, which is, how do we create a CPQ light, which is more of an abstraction than it is a new product. So it's not a new product. It's just kind of, how do you abstract away the complexity of CPQ for customers who are B to B, plg, who are who are just kind of touching the edges of a CPQ solution, right?

Can you incrementally monetize?\n\nSpeaker 2  6:29 Yeah, okay. And what about things like compliance and stuff like that? Do we ever get into the weeds? So, because the one problem with Vibe quoting is it doesn't have compliance baked into it. But I wonder if that actually matters. You just want something that moves the cheese on the CPQ market right when you go to what you want, something go that kind of cool demo. Get everyone off. The spreadsheet integrates with next, our next generation of CPQ so that you can get the compliance. You can get the quote done, you can get it signed off.

If we start talking about self serve, I know that works in Amir, and I know it works in APAC, but does it create noise, or does it add in in Noam?\n\nSpeaker 1  10:56 It adds in Noam, especially if we're going to start going back after the high growth B to B SAS finance led sector, okay, okay. Because I would say, you know, two out of three of those companies are plg emergence,\n\nSpeaker 2  11:14 all right. And then also, there's this increasing trend of SLG to plg, right? And in fact, I often think that SLG and plg are a little bit too rigid. It's basically, what's the gradient between self serve and sales assisted, right? Totally, yeah, okay. Totally. So is that a message? Because the the the trying to work out what to what to say to keep everybody happy without having this kind of shit pot of no product is quite difficult in Zora, but it seems to me like if you can, if you can build the slider and let this the GMs position each customer on the slider themselves, create little friction. I mean the billing implementation. I heard the other day that we have reference implementations for billing that can get less complex, B to B businesses up in four to six weeks. And my question is, Why does no one use those or talk about those? Why is it all GS LED?\n\nSpeaker 1  12:16 Yeah, I think a lot of it's actually not even GS LED. Gs has been the problem, right? And Jess will show up and go, What do you want to do? Yeah? And they'll go replicate every fucking old business process the customer has because their style grows, yeah. What I see working is like, Robbie started pushing on this, like, integration scorecard, yeah. Minimise customizations. Time to live out of the box. Like, that's what I feel like is driving a lot of this, yeah, because I at the same orb com is a perfect example. We signed that thing at the end of last month. They want to get live in January. Yeah, they're crazy. $250 million business, but the CEO is, like, out of the box. Anybody says otherwise, yeah, let me know now, like so I think we're seeing more of that.\n\nSpeaker 2  13:08 Okay, I had the same experience with immediate when I went back to clariss, who worked and I said, What should we have done? They said, if you'd given us a reference architecture, we'd have had 80% done in three months, and then we'd have spent a little bit of time on the",

Well, now that Jonathan owns all of these core components, I own the fucking commerce platform, every single foundational component, from the contact service PCs to experiences to rules engine to workflow. These are all mine. I own them. Okay, so now imagine a world. This is the deal, hub experience. First step is you define a channel.

This is what the label I'm going to tag this thing is, because I know later I'm going to have marketing campaigns. I'm going to do a to b, AB testing on this specific channel. Yeah. So I've defined the channel. I've defined the source of that channel with a specific label or tag. Now I get to build the experience for that.

Yeah, I agree with that. I think so that's the useful frame, because it doesn't doesn't detract from the use cases can be pretty diverse. They can go from self serve to sales LED. So that that works. So that frame, plg and SLG can be a little bit of a red herring. They can be distracting because we kind of compliance like B to C. Well, B to C means so much so. Plg, SLG. They create these delineations that actually don't exist. As you just described. What you want is the customer. We take the customer lens. What does the customer want to do at that point in time? And then they can run through that sequence. And when they do have to hit, you know, I need that button, or I want to speak to a service rep or a sales agent. I don't need something full blown.

Started very plg motion, yeah, no, let me flip that around. Started with the Yeah, no, no. Started with a heavy SLG motion. Thank you. Sorry, heavy SLG motion. And realise this channel is fucking expensive. Our CAC is too high. It's really hard. Creates a corporate mandate. 70% of all sales need to come from a plg, motion, no longer an SLG. They went down. They went down. They said, look, it's too expensive to and by the way, in this agent world, this AI world, sales reps not gonna be buying and selling things.

Then to think about the self serve customers that begin at plg, right? Like, if we can go up and down that spectrum, which is, like, all of the stuff that I'm talking about, it's nothing to do with you.\n\nSpeaker 1  7:30 So maybe I wasn't. We've had many teams work on this. And in fact, we had a seed edition Zora, 150 customers on seed edition. What was seed edition? It's literally in our billing code already. Yeah, it's so what did they do? They with precision some pm said, hide this feature. Hide this feature. Hide this feature. Seed edition. Yeah, right, yeah, right. Because then you can grow up to the big edition and you just unhide the toggles. You're good to go. So why, why did this motion die at Zora, too much manpower. Because, sorry, it started off with too much churn. CFO said, Yeah, I can handle this churn. I'm about to IPO, yeah, I can't have them seeing a 30% churn. All right, so then that killed that motion. Then reference implementation came in. And why did that motion die? That motion died because Global Services, to your point was like, hey, customers want complex now they could just be bullshitting because they have a big number to pit, most probably, but they came up with that. Otherwise we'd be fixed cost, price, price. We do so many things to drive more deals, but they got in the way. So then we went to all these mid tier partners. The product leader Karthik, was smart enough to be like, Hey, fuck you, Global Services. I'm gonna go sign up with a bunch of elite partners. So what like mid tier partners? Rev gurus is a great example of one that will do half a revenue implementation. So what did the sales sales team loves it. What did the Global Services team come in? He started creating noise and saying, hey, those partners suck. They don't know how to implement this product. Your customer sat is bad. So now the sales team were convinced that these guys all need the elite services people, because nobody knows Zora as much as Zora does. So that's how they started to move deals away from those mid tiers and low tier. And in fact, Paulo has zero strategic partners in his region, Mark has zero strategic partners. These is all no end business.\n\nUnknown Speaker  9:46 Then we realise, hey, we can't kill\n\nSpeaker 1  9:51 the partners. Bring in the big deals. See how our mind works.

So I'm just trying to get the framing of this. There's a disjoint for me, which is the political barriers. Yeah, like those. I would just ignore those. I would just move through them that that's not how I would typically. I wouldn't respond to that. So that's one thing. The other thing is this, you're already saying to me that the that the constituent parts, which is the slider between plg and SLG. We're the only business that can do that right. The structure of the commerce business can be a thing where that slider becomes very fluid. You can, you can be anywhere on that on that line. And you can also tactically choose B to C, like stellantis or GM, and say, Okay, well, you know where we can also do that sliver of B to C, there's a, there's a, there's a recognition from Manfred Errol and nav and Satish, that that's a good motion. There's a guardrail, which you say, which I agree is protect the core, which is about delivering and insulating the core roadmap, but then strategically improving the capability of us to move that slider up and down with ease. So as you say, Omni channel, the the experiences, on top of CPQ, all of that kind of stuff, says, in my translation of that is slightly different to yours, because I'm still assimilating what you're telling me. The unlock to that is that there is an architectural principle that's underlying everything that we do, which is that we duplicate or share thinking around one thing. So for example, what's a rules engine that has many versions of what in see in the commerce side, different versions of what that thing is and should be? Should the rules be in the catalogue? Should it be a rule service? Should that have constraints to it? Where should the constraints live? So that becomes a bit of a soup. Context, for example, is heavily indexed against the catalogue. But if you pull that out as a shared service, context does exactly what you what you talked about, as you expand the utility of context, and it becomes part of CPQ, and you get all of that richness of the kind of pre quote that you were talking about. So that's kind of a simple view of it, but it feels to me like what you could do is you could say, Listen, the prince, the direction of travel is we have, we have a slider. We have a Unified Commerce leader. Now there are these. Here are some examples of the things that we can do to give us that slide up and down, and it will service to mark, to go to markets, because it if I, if I go to power and so listen, first of all, I'm uncovering the these reference, the all these bones that are buried all over the place. You know, I don't give a shit about GS. I'm going to give you what you need. It partially already built. I'm going to polish it up, I'm going to package it up, and I give you a story that's your four week implementation. Clariss, you go off and sell that EMEA APAC, you sell that second bit is, we're good at self serve to sales lead. We can move you up and down that slider to do that, here's three principles you know now that I get, you know, business context, service, intelligent orchestrator in the middle, and actions, right? And then the L threes, the products themselves consume a lot of these. The the Errol and Manfred become stakeholders, but there are customers. And here are these services. It gives us that slider, so it's the same story, but it, but it, I don't know, with a slightly different you're telling it to me in a slightly different way. Why would I care about the way the business has done it before, right? I mean, like I can be encumbered by that, and I can go, Okay, I've\n\nSpeaker 1  14:35 because you don't have control over building a plg motion, you alone, don't have\n\nSpeaker 2  14:43 control over you mean the sale",

So this is, could\n\nUnknown Speaker  14:58 you give me an example of what would, what would that be?\n\nSpeaker 1  15:01 So that would be like, okay, in the old world, how we did the plg motion is that there was a test drive site. That test drive site you would go to, literally, zora.com forward slash test drive, you would sign up for a form. That form would create an opportunity in Salesforce. It would validate your email address. It would say, hey, you've got a Gmail email address. We don't do trials for Gmail or Hotmail. Yeah, it would do a dupe check. It would say, hey, like, you already signed up for a trial like it, and then follows rules passed. Then it would actually create your tenant, and we owned the Provisioning Service. But then somebody would get that opportunity landing in their inbox. So Jack Friel would get that email, picking a random sales rep, and then that sales rep would be like, Hey, thanks for signing up for trial. Like, that's our plg motion, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2  15:58 I see, yeah, that's where all right, I'm, I'm, are you talking I'm talking about something different customers. I'm, yeah, I'm talking about our customers. Plg, right, so this is, this is where the naming matters,\n\nUnknown Speaker  16:12\n\nyes. So like\n\nSpeaker 2  16:15 Paulo on $150 million 50 million euros, AI startup in Europe.\n\nSpeaker 1  16:22 So wait, but you are building an plg motion for customers. That's all manfred's world. Sorry, Errol's world.\n\nSpeaker 2  16:30 Yeah, yeah. But the Yeah, you all right, so maybe we're Yeah, so I'm what I'm talking about is not our plg to SLG. I see I'm talking about our customers, and which is where I'm thinking the disjoint is so. So what Paulo misses, yeah, is I go to a $50 million 50 million euro AI startup growing it, you know, growing super fast. He goes in, there's two problems he's got in the back of his mind, yeah. Number one is going to take a 304th you know, two or $300,000 GS implementation, right? Doesn't want to do that. What he wants to do is he wants to do a 50 or $60,000 implementation for that company, right? So, in his mind, he does not have a reference architecture, he does not have speedy, no billing, but they all do, yeah, but they but that's partly my job, right? They know. Is that your job? But then, well, they don't have he doesn't think he has it. So if I know where it is, and I can work with Ken to say that's the thing that I need, then that's just a constituent of the total story,\n\nSpeaker 1  17:41 yeah, but that's still not in your wheelhouse, because you you're not in the line of fire at all. When it comes to these deals coming through, they don't call Jonathan when the deal comes through, yeah, they go to a technical architecture Review Board, which then gives them a what is that thing called rom No, some average cost of implementation. It's your initial quote, right? Yeah. Then, then they bicker back and forth on like, hey, GS, why are you charging this much? Yeah, he doesn't want that. That's the block. But he doesn't have to do that, but he does do it, but he can go to any partner. This is the problem,\n\nUnknown Speaker  18:24 but that, but there's a, there's um, let\n\nSpeaker 1  ",

Fixed includes these\n\nSpeaker 2  21:18 pieces, and it died because of the politics or because no one bought it,\n\nSpeaker 1  21:23 I don't have real information, so I think you should talk to Randy, who helped drive it. And I think I don't know. Look, I don't trust global services so, but I'm\n\nSpeaker 2  21:46 kind of, isn't our isn't that part of the reason for having two people sit across the whole product that some of these inefficiencies can be solved collectively. Why? Like, let's just say, take one problem. I say, Okay, I'm gonna solve for your problem, right? I'm gonna, I'm gonna work with Ken to give you a thing that exists, or you don't think exists, whatever it is. I don't know what the history I mean, Paolo is a smart guy, right? So he's kind of, that's his presentation. To me, if it's got an agenda, that's fine, but it, I can give you that thing. That's the that's the billing implementation. As reference architect, Claris has had the same gripe, by the way, you know, on immediate media. So if we'd have had a reference implementation, we could have got 80% of the way, and it wouldn't have been the pain that it was, and, you know, they're not super fans of GS as well. There's a, you know, anyway, so there's, so maybe he does, maybe is there? Maybe isn't. Maybe he does know it is there, but it's, there's something missing that, hey, that's that's perceived as one of the biggest blockers for 60% of his his revenue is billing and GS, that's how, that's how he frames it. And I know Mark has got a similar case, but because he, but he's gone off and solved it in a different way, right? So there's that.

The story is lost in the core road maps, because my point, my point is that the intersection is how our customers see us, right? The intersection is how they want to use the product. But the intersection is not owned. The intersection is a product. It is a road map independently of itself. You can't try and people in these, you know, Errol and Manfred are very focused on what they want to deliver. When Errol says I need this, or Manford says, I need this, that's a dependency. The dependency has this, you know, this additional workload concept. So what I want to try and do with NAV is to, is to abstract away the things that enable the commerce vision, like the intersection and and this is not about building something new. This is about making sure that it's has a focus, which means we can deliver this seamless experience, right? So everything that you just described, I think, needs that abstraction, but that's actually solving for the European problem, which is, I have smaller plg targets who don't need quote yet, but they would buy us if they think that ripping out stripe or doing something in three years means they should be buying for five or 10 years.

Those are the people that should own this, not you, or you should hire those people.

There's other people who should be owning this, like, it could be Joe grey, she's solution like, or it could be, look, I've also advocated for the partner. There's a team called PDS, so you need to talk to Sujit as well. PDS team built is actually building an AI implementation pack right now, in partnership with s to it. So what does it do? It essentially reads your APIs from stripe, it transforms the data and then loads it into Zora. So they own this little agent that does that, so he's doing new, innovative things. So like, my feedback to you is, like, the way you solve it is very product centric, meaning you're going to have these templatized experiences. You'll have template experiences. You'll have template catalogue. Maybe there's when you hit the create button, it says, Hey, like, what kind of products you have. Or you'll have a copilot type of experience. You use AI to start driving this stuff, where you can point to some other system. It can log in, and you can access your stuff and pull it so my my ask for you is to solve it in a productized way. But if you're going to solve it, and I'm going to kill GS way, then you go toss it over the fence to somebody who knows the GS world, and you get out of the way, because the last thing you want to do is, like, Jonathan's, Jonathan's killed GS. Like, that's not the label you want it.\n\nSpeaker 2  27:59 Yeah, you know, there's, there's a, I mean, I can navigate that. I think what I'm trying to do is frame it in a way that you are aligned and that Pete is aligned. So the the framing that I put to everybody is almost identical to what you said, which is, we are we can do plg to SLG. I mean, self serve to self LED. There's a, there's an efficient way to do that. The broader story that I can take to Paulo is the collaboration across the rest of the org. I'm not worried. That actually doesn't worry me. It's, it's, it's, how do you frame\n\nUnknown Speaker  28:43 what the product is meant to do\n\nSpeaker 2  28:46 in a way that I can then use that as a story and a lever into suppo",

So if the act of creation of subscription or the vehicle is ordered, then that lands in the acquisition to order space. Subscription lands in that space, but that overlap is I have to influence how that interaction manifests. But do you think this team has influence on that? Because then that, I think so, because the order is going to be the thing here, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  5:10 I think that's the trend between, yeah, what we do in Ken's org\n\nSpeaker 1  5:14 does, is it overlap somewhere? Yeah, definitely.\n\nSpeaker 2  5:18 I mean, I'm super interested. I'm spending time with them tomorrow payments, how payments intersect it? Because I like his payment strategy. That's really good. But, yeah, I agree with you, alright, so that's the data bit. So the bit I was thinking is, you know, we like 20 slides here, so I don't have to rattle through these, yeah? But BCS, so there were two things. There was next gen, CP CPQ, though, how does that use? Everything that I would have just set up, and then BCS. And I wonder if we, I guess the question in the room is going to be, bring it to life. For me, what does actually an intersection mean? What does that represent?\n\nSpeaker 1  6:06 If you think from your perspective, what would that look like bringing to life? Thing? Would you be able to visualise something and say, This is what it should look like? What do you think?\n\nSpeaker 2  6:17 I mean? I think, I think, you know, you could do you. So if you think about the customer journey, it's there's two, two obvious points. One is the complete self serve customer that I think that's where BCS feels like, really powerful. Then there's the next gen, there's the abstraction of CPQ light, right? So if you think about those two things, that they're down here,\n\nSpeaker 1  6:51 and maybe the third, the complex BDB, let's just throw that in complex bpq as well, because this is what happens then. Like you are saying, story comes to life that we paint. If I'm to stretch or take what you were thinking further, there are three types of interaction that can take place. If I map everything back to the strategy graph that you have, that we play here, we are weaker in and all that three type of interaction that can take place, which is self serve, like transactions from CPU perspective or proper CPQ enterprise transaction in every interaction. If I see what we need to demonstrate is this whole interaction layer stays the same and plays a part in delivering custom experiences to each of\n\nSpeaker 2  7:41 these interactions, because then what you're doing is you're saying the effort that we're making doesn't support just stage one and stage two. Stage two, yes, it supports our story. Who will get? What a better thing? Yes, 100% yes, that's what. So what I'd like to do is I would like, I mean this, I'm dropping this on yo",

There's a few bullet points you could bring out on BCS, right?\n\nUnknown Speaker  8:20 This is all about experiences.\n\nUnknown Speaker  8:24\n\nWell, this is basically,\n\nSpeaker 2  8:27 yeah, I guess the question is, is it next gen, CPQ, light, or how do we think about it?\n\nSpeaker 1  8:34 I would want to take that opportunity. And I'm just throwing an idea. I'm not saying that you throw a grenade in there, that you subtly say, don't think of next gen CPQ, but think of it as a next generation of CPQ, through next generation of CPQ, the way the componentization, we are going to strategize and bring Manfred into support on that, because I do not know if he bought into what I was saying, because he's focused on B to B\n\nUnknown Speaker  8:58 complex right now. He's pulled into this.\n\nSpeaker 1  9:00 Then it's good. Then I would say that, hey, he thinks the right 100% the right direction, perfect. Then all we got to say over there is next gen of CPQ, not next gen CP connection of CPQ is going to be supported by these intersection layer things, and the experience will automatically be personalised using BCS, because our experience there is also going to be contextual from where you are landing. That's the message that we got to give. Because what we are again and again saying is you're not building different CPQ here and there you are building the core components. And thanks to BCS, and thanks to our intelligent experience management, we can render what you want that and you can switch on and off the components that you don't want to show for B to B, you may want to show extra components, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  9:49 So if I show, if I put a slide together that says next generation of CPQ,\n\nUnknown Speaker  9:57 does it reference guided selling or not?\n\nSpeaker 1  10:00 It should reference guided selling for the complicated ones. I think the lighter ones probably don't\n\nUnknown Speaker  10:04 need, Alright, so next generate generation of CPQ,\n\nSpeaker 2  10:09 I can say unlocking CPQ, light, yeah. And then we talk about how context? How would you describe context? I'm going\n\nUnknown Speaker  10:22 to give you this document first. Sure,\n\nUnknown Speaker  10:30 yeah, you sent me the BCS stuff.\n\nUnknown Speaker  10:32 No, not just BCS, the next gen CPQ. Next Gen CPQ. I'll just send it again. So\n\nSpeaker 1  10:51 I just sent it to you again. So basically, where was my listed of this, if I can find that listed and maybe we can talk to them, the diagrams have to be simple. I we cannot have I've learned this way.\n\nUnknown Speaker  11:06 Yeah, my maid of what you and I showed up here,\n\nSpeaker 1  11:13 people sometimes when I do diagrams like this, like flow diagrams,\n\nSpeaker 2  11:18 people can't consume it, yeah? I that's in the background.\n\nSpeaker 1  11:22 Yeah, I've lost people, several like this is how the full movie, and people looking at me. I learned it over time. But nobody an architect\n\nSpeaker 2  11:30 in front of them, engineer, people can't challenge it, and therefore they just shut up, yeah, just or the ones that can speak up, yes, and then you go down a rabbit hole.\n\nSpeaker 1  11:40 Yes, it's not that they won't, they will. And it goes, yeah, so All right, what I'm thinking about this, it does unlock next and CPQ, but the architect or the slide should not be an architecture slide should ",

When it deciphers what needs to happen, it sources in the right components and the right flows to be triggered, and that's what the customers get per interaction, but it is completely abstracted from them. And this is where the front ends of the catalogue or the CPQ or everything sits, but this is a common layer.\n\nSpeaker 2  12:39 So would you say so when you talk about, how would you configure a c1 seeing a CPQ light\n\nSpeaker 1  12:50 the way I'm thinking about that you got somewhere in Zora.\n\nUnknown Speaker  12:59\n\nOkay, so\n\nSpeaker 1  13:02 step one, you bought Zora, and let's say\n\nSpeaker 2  13:06 you sell using this is the CPQ light story, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  13:09 I'm giving you overarching CPQ, and the way I'm going to go there, I feel it'll answer CPQ light and heavy to Zola. To play Zola. There is nothing in there. I go to my intelligent context manager, or BCS, whatever name sticks, and I'm going to just set up my context, because I know what my context\n\nSpeaker 2  13:35 is going to look like the same. This is the c1 right? This is a c1 right? Yeah. So this\n\nSpeaker 1  13:39 session attributes I've already suggested. There are some other attributes I've suggested you just set it up. Completely done. Okay, now what BCS does not have today is it doesn't have the smarts of interactions. It doesn't know that if interaction is product browsing, some context attributes may not be needed. That is in development on that the roadmap that we need to do, but imagine that it has tomorrow. Second, once I have it now, I need to visualise what my experience is going to look like. Let's say I got 2c ones, c1 here. This guy knows CPQ. This guy knows my self service. And they say they define a flow. They define I need product browsing, from product browsing. I need recommendations from recommendations. I need to go to check out. Okay, over here, I say I have a guided selling flow. This is my guided selling flow. There is product browsing, one to product browsing, two to product browsing, three. Okay, that then takes me to, you know, recommendations, guardrail checks, which can probably go here and then find the code\n\nUnknown Speaker  15:01 that's been configured by the c1\n\nSpeaker 1  15:03 or is the flow? The flow needs to be ultimately told by c1 this is my sales reps want, right? It's like building my Commerce pages, my Commerce experience.\n\nUnknown Speaker  15:13 And that's the simple flow.\n\nSpeaker 1  15:15 That's the way they want it, right? When they want this. Basically what happened is, I'm going to go to my intersection layer of experience that library, in that library, I'm going to bring it, sorry, I'm going to bring this from here, and I'm going to bring the same element from here, over here, right? This is the same element that, let's say, which is product browsing element. I'm using the same thing from here, but all I'm doing is passing different contexts. That's all I'm doing. Maybe this is also the same component. Quoting is something that I need here, but I don't need quoting here. Or maybe I do preview right, and the guardrails and all that is not here because, or maybe should be here because you are checking something, but I think you get the idea that this is my list of components that you can and you will shop the components from this. You will put it here, but it builds your flow. The flow cannot be built. You will ship the flows. You will ship some pre built CPQ from Zola, but you will have to allow the users to customise, and\n\nUnknown Speaker  16:21 that's driven by the context that\n\nUnknown Speaker  16:25 what's available to them is driven by\n\nSpeaker 1  16:27 the context. What's available to you is driven by the context. What you can build over here, you have the library, but you can use course or standard, because ultimately, even here, I envision you will have a commerce experience that is out of the box so that you don't have to build anything. But if you want to customise, sure,\n\nSpeaker 2  16:45 CPQ live, right? Yes, you have a out of the box version,\n\nUnknown Speaker  16:52 and then you can track in\n\nSpeaker 1  16:53 additional and whatever you want. I don't have any problems in the complicated version. You can think that I need to throw in product configurator, which is complicated stuff over I exist that we just have to come up with a list. Once I have that list, you will see that there is a lot of commonality, and we drag it down and say this common stuff is\n\nSpeaker 2  17:14 just so that. So that's that's context and experiences, yes. What else? What about the intelligent commerce engine?\n\nSpeaker 1  17:25 The intelligent commerce engine is basically, again, when you did experiences, you did the widgets only. How do I pass the data from ",

Experience is just this space, this space, this space, this widget.\n\nSpeaker 2  17:49 So is that what intelligent commerce is to you? Yeah, is a, is the a\n\nSpeaker 1  17:53 flow orchestrator? Find a name for that. For me, that is a flow orchestrator, that I can bring your flow to life. I can bring your entire journey orchestrator, maybe.\n\nSpeaker 2  18:05 And is that the thing that's connecting to the L threes?\n\nSpeaker 1  18:09 Yes, that is the thing that talks to L threes.\n\nSpeaker 2  18:12 And the L threes are actually experiences, also an l3 as well, right? Isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 1  18:16 Which is, will have to be l3 Yes, yeah, yes. But this guy knows that I can go to rules now, I can go to product now. This is basically my major broker. What is happening here is I can't have this guy. I don't want this guy to go to the APIs directly, because I know what APIs are. This is plasmid. Case in point. We are building our own set of functions using multiple APIs in there, right? So I don't want to go to that level of detail, because that's exactly where.\n\nSpeaker 2  18:53 And each of those things that you talked about there are actions. Check out,\n\nSpeaker 1  18:59 yeah, check out could be action. Product browsing is action. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2  19:03 So that follows this flow that you've talked Yes, which is, I have the I have an experience at the beginning. I wonder what the experience at the beginning is that the interaction\n\nSpeaker 1  19:15 is the super simple, vanilla experience I would think that we are sending but that experience is not like I don't see that experience as one experience component. We have tied together everything, and we have shifted this is Zona out of the box commerce, right, which is one of the flows versions of the flow, so templated flows, that if you're a media customer, we believe this works for you. If you're a SaaS company, we believe this works for you. So you you got a library of those things, that's how I think. And you got to choose what works for you, or you build your own. But we're not\n\nSpeaker 2  19:55 when you buy Sora, we can't abstract all absorb, creating a whole layer on topic. So it feels like some things. It feels like this, like if you want complex you just get vanilla Zora at this stage. What we're really building for is the stage one and stage\n\nSpeaker 1  20:15 two customers fine, because we can't bite the whole thing. Yeah, I'm okay.\n\nSpeaker 2  20:19 So stage one is you want just a reference implementation. You want the, you know, self serve to check out. That's, that's all you need. Then, then you bring in the stage two, which is a little bit more as a CPQ ish bit to it, but again, that's abstracted away. Yeah, CPQ is easy to abstract away because it's containerized. That's all it is to box, right? Yes, you have, when you get to building complex, it feels like that's not a place you want to play.\n\nSpeaker 1  20:53 I would say I'm still optimistic we can, but we can talk more about it, because I think that's a layer where I need, probably, I need to bring you on the journey as well, because I don't see B to B complex or CPQ complex for us to be that place where we have to be like big machine, kind of a CPQ, they're super complicated, but we don't need to be that. I don't think so. You're still going to play, and I hope so in complex SaaS space, or in you're not playing in, let's call it engineering design space that needs a CPU, that is way more complicated. You're in visibility study. You're bringing in engineering parts and inventory and all that we don't play with that. Yeah, so complexity is still limited. That's why I'm saying there is a way that we can make it happen. But you don't have to go to that point tonight itself.\n\nSpeaker 2  21:59 So is the once I've set this up and I say, Okay, I want now up to bring it to life, what we're going to look at is the stage one and stage two. How do we unlock that? I agree with you. There's a stage three. I wonder if, yeah, I think, I think you're right. I think if you don't do all three of them, that feels like 10 or 15 minutes of talking. Now, are you prepared to do that?\n\nSpeaker 1  22:26 I can talk through that right now. But I think in your conversation with Manfred, did he? Did he explain where he wants to target for complex? Because complex is just a word, but within complex, there is a spectrum.\n\nUnknown Speaker  22:41 Yeah, our conversation centred around\n\nUnknown Speaker  22:48\n\nbringing CPQ\n\nSpeaker 2  22:51 to a self serve customer, right? So self configuring that like, yeah, that's where he he I stayed away from the upper end, because I feel like that's baked into the road maps already. I want to unpack the road maps later, not now. So I said that, you know, he said to me, Listen, you know, I'm buying what you're selling, but your bigge",

He believes that from his product down is a huge opportunity, but he doesn't have bandwidth for that.\n\nSpeaker 1  23:32 What I think you should sell is also that what we are building can be built in a way that it automatically caters to the people or other customers below that tier as well, because it should be composable rather than, hey, this is a monolith like architecture that you've got to have everything. Which is where the argument for building reference architecture comes. Give me everything I get it. Give me a reference architecture, what I should use and how I should use, because it's too much for me, right? Same argument will go for CPQ. Oh, my God, so much. No, no, I don't need it. Give me smaller version.\n\nSpeaker 2  24:07 I think that's the story. Is to say, Listen, this, this has no impact on next, the next generation of CPQ. It's all about this abstraction, its experiences, its context. It's the intelligent commerce, orchestrator, all of that kind of everything that you just described to me up here is, is that thing? And it feels like what Pete and Shakir will be thinking in the back of their minds is who's going to build this stuff right that we will get to that's going to be a conversation.\n\nSpeaker 1  24:40 But here is again a suggestion. The if they ask this question and I was in your place, I would say, don't forget that without this, none of what we're doing will exist or will be shaped. So technically in some shape we are formed. These things are being built, however, not abstracted, within the flow\n\nUnknown Speaker  25:03\n\nstuff going on.\n\nSpeaker 1  25:04 So what we need to do is, without impacting the roadmap, we need to isolate those things so abstract those things and give them enough air cover so that they are built properly and care of it. That's the exercise we need to do. And it's not an exercise that can be done in three days, agree? Well, yeah, my other answer\n\nSpeaker 2  25:23 will be, he already gave this to you two weeks ago. Oh, okay, so I think we're like, we've got quite a way down the track, but there's still, you know, nav and I have only had four conversations. So this doesn't get built overnight, alright? So, So stage one, stage two, stage three is going to be your bit,\n\nSpeaker 1  25:46 yeah, and then you tell me him, and we will chat again, okay?\n\nSpeaker 2  25:49 And then what I'm going to do is I'm just going to finish off with some reality checking. Secures. Asked for land mines and road blocks.\n\nSpeaker 1  25:59 Am I building any slide? Or I'm not required to build a slide.\n\nSpeaker 2  26:03 Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess I can\n\nUnknown Speaker  26:08 think I can build one, but I just, I'm not sure\n\nSpeaker 1  26:10 if it's going to fit your see where you go. I mean, we'll touch base tomorrow morning, anywhere. Yeah, we have to sit together and build something, and we can talk about what we can present. I would be honest, I will definitely look for your feedback on some of the presentations or some of the slides I've done. I'm very good at presenting to the technical people, like, this is the architecture visit, but I have seen that when I present it to like some shaky or others, people look at me and go like, this is deep. So I think we need to abstract it to a point where people look at it like, get the high level. That's enough for me. Now the next version, we don't have a Docker order here. We can build something like that. Yeah, I agree\n\nSpeaker 2  26:51 with I think it's only three slides. Let's just put this in. You've got the bullet points in BCS. You sent me that Doc. I can extract the one side. It just makes sense. Stage two is what we just talked on, using experiences sure and context and intelligent commerce to build an abstraction of the next generation of CPQ. Correct, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  27:15 Anyway, is happening hard? Not hard coded, but hard coded in plasmic we need to pull it out. Example of rebuilding the APIs,\n\nSpeaker 2  27:26 I agree, although people won't know that it's happening in plasma. We just need to say, I think we just you and I in the background. Need to just shift how Jimmy thinks about and Taylor think about experiences.\n\nSpeaker 1  27:38 I think I can convince Taylor, but Jimmy is very much like, No, give me this.\n\nSpeaker 2  27:43 Yeah, spoken to Jimmy, and I've fallen out a few times. He's not collaborative at all. And it also doesn't see the bigger picture. He wants just that thing so he can deliver his thing. Well, that's fine, but there's a broader story here, so I'll deal with Jimmy. And then the lot, the bit I don't think I have enough of a handle on is, is how this enables the stage three story.\n\nSpeaker 1  28:09 Find 15 minutes tomorrow, we can go deeper. And I'll give you my point of view so that you can synthesise,\n\nSpeaker 3  28:15 because this is stage three, right? Yeah. Okay. Other is this? Yeah, and let's go clean.\n\nSpeaker 1  28:23 Oka",

    "content": ", what is stage three? Let's give me your definition of stage three, and then we'll start from there.\n\nSpeaker 2  28:29 Well, stage three is, in my mind, stage three was insulated product roadmap, but you're throwing in the idea that what we build here supports B to be complex.\n\nSpeaker 1  28:41 Yeah? So when you say it's the insulating product roadmap, but if I map it to your strategy, stage three is complex.\n\nSpeaker 2  28:51 Yeah, I haven't, to be frank with you, I haven't touched that. I just thought, Well,\n\nSpeaker 1  28:55 no, we don't need to. We're not gonna say, if you say that we're touching that, people are gonna click, oh my Yeah. They're all freak out. Yeah, we're not going to do that. So what we are seeing stage three, it catered to some person, some category of our customers, and that we are seeing is B to B complex, Isn't it correct?\n\nUnknown Speaker  29:15\n\nRight? That's That's all\n\nSpeaker 1  29:18 basically what is happening here. What are the things I'm building here? Let's say it needs my BCS for sure, from Arrow's perspective, yes, it needs merchandising as well, what arrow calls merchandising, which is basically bundling and stuff like that, which means it needs my advanced rules and constraints, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  29:46 See, that's the bit we haven't probably touched on. Is that I again, where I'm slightly confused, is this idea of catalogue rules like that live? Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1  30:01 No, that's I'll tell you my perspective. I do not some of the things that Errol says, I don't fight with him on you have your point of view. Say what you're saying right now. I don't care about mine.\n\nSpeaker 2  30:12 Feels like something outside. It doesn't feel like something inside. The capital rules. It's, yeah, I mean, for me, I think a rule is, as I understood it, you know, greater than No, that's an attribute. Greater than 50 million is an attribute.\n\nSpeaker 1  30:29 So rule is, if it is greater than 50 then market mark, the price of buy. That's a rule, right? That's a rule. Or the rule is, you buy this product, you cannot buy this product. If you bought this product and this product, you get 10% discount. If you bought this and this, then you cannot buy\n\nSpeaker 2  30:48 three rules and constraints in your language.\n\nSpeaker 1  30:51 Those are the rules and constraints. So they live in the catalogue. Today. This is where arrow believes and live. But I believe you can say that it lives. It needs catalogue.\n\nSpeaker 2  31:02 Was it a service? It's not baked into the catalogue.\n\nUnknown Speaker  31:04 No, no, no, it is outside. It's a service,\n\nSpeaker 2  31:08 okay, but that's like this BCS. When I realised BCS wasn't it's like, we talk about it, BCS is service, right? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  31:17 So, okay, let me, let me clarify this. This is why sometimes I don't go to the level of art nuance with Harold. Some days he'll get it, but what I learned with him is let him speak. Let him speak. Give him something, give him something. And here, give him everything. And I was like, yeah, that is all I wanted. Okay, so, um, so this is catalogue. What is the catalogue? Catalogue is nothing but a listing of products, plans. You can argue price should be in the catalogue, but fine, I can abstract prices out in the pricing machine, in the price books. Let's say, Isn't that the\n\nUnknown Speaker  31:59\n\nprice waterfall?\n\nSpeaker 1  32:00 Price waterfall is, we spoke about right? Price waterfall is the outcome. For example, I applied discounts. I want to know that you started with $100 you apply. This is a waterfall that we need to come to. Okay? So this is catalogue, right? You got price books. You got pricing rules as well. What is the input to pricing rule? The input to pricing rule will be the data coming from context manager or BCS, and I can have additional data coming to this as well. Entitlements may influence my price as well. If you have these entitlements, my price may change, right? Where are the entitlements coming from? Entitlements are not coming from catalogue. Entitlements are coming from my subscription engine for now. Zens, right. So would you say pricing rules sitting catalogue, right? That's the point here, right? The fact that I, as a catalogue owner, and building the pricing rules, or I'm thinking about it, should not mean the pricing rules lie in catalogue. This is outside. Can take inputs from them's subscription account, catalogue context, I don't know, take any input, but this is the pricing group. Same goes for merchandising rules, because my product bundling decision may not be\n\nSpeaker 2  33:28 just consumes what's available in the capital, right, right.\n\nUnknown Speaker  33:33 So, but then what is,\n\nSpeaker 2  33:35 sorry, just to back up a little bit, what's the difference between a service like that. I mean, for example, where would pricing rules be? I know what it consumes, but whereas where it's where's this utility beyond the catalogue,\n\nSpeaker 1  33:49 when you are in the pr",

Similarly, merchandising rule. Now, merchandising rules could be as simple as I'm only putting product to product rules this product can be upgraded to this or cannot be\n\nSpeaker 2  34:22 upgraded to this. But, sure, but let me ask you a question. Would you all right? So at the moment, these things live in Errol's\n\nUnknown Speaker  34:31\n\nJira, right? Yep,\n\nSpeaker 2  34:36 I kind of feel that we would shape, that's where we shape that roadmap. But we it's not an intersection. It's an itch. I mean, you're 100% right. You shouldn't build it for just the context of, you know, with that catalogue lens,\n\nUnknown Speaker  34:55 but it should be something that's obviously bigger.\n\nSpeaker 2  34:58 Feel that that is all right, but that argument means it is an intersection. Yeah, I think the way to maybe do this is to say there may be other intersections. We're just covering three of them. Now, if I, if I throw that in tomorrow,\n\nSpeaker 1  35:15 you can just say that we are working through the exam. This is, these are just the examples, but there are more. We don't want to overload you. This is the philosophy we are bringing in.\n\nSpeaker 2  35:22 So we just talk about BCS, we talk about orchestrating, we talk about actions.\n\nUnknown Speaker  35:28 Yeah, you can actually take the rules.\n\nSpeaker 1  35:33 Maybe not. Rules is too lower level to be discussed with that audience. You can say that rules and constraint is also interaction, basically an intersection thing.\n\nSpeaker 2  35:42 We put it as an l3 originally. So yes, you and I get, it's an l3 but it's, it's also an intersection. That's, that's the stuff we got to work out. Let's get, let's, let's not get into the weeds. I think less is more.\n\nSpeaker 1  35:57 So you know what we need, just one last thing, yeah, we should not talk about rules and constraints as rules and constraints. What does it serve is what become an intersection? Right? That's the guard rails is. What is an intersection? I can serve guardrails through hard coded FLS, or I can serve guard rails like custom functions all through rules. Rules is a means to it. That's why it is an l3 what does it serve and who controls it? Is compliance. Compliance is your intersection. That's what we should say, that it's basically\n\nUnknown Speaker  36:36 going to be needed in every commerce flow.\n\nSpeaker 1  36:40 So rules by price waterfall, these are all compliance elements that need to be put in here.\n\nSpeaker 2  36:46 Yeah, I think this is where you and I have to spend quite a bit of time, because it's, there's two lenses, right? There's the internal you just took something from my roadmap, and then there's the the logic that says this is an intersection and this is not an intersection, yeah? If we don't get that right, we'll lose people, yeah? So I really, I think compliance feels like compliance feels potentially so you were going through your stage three there. So, yeah, how are you going to frame stage three? Is we do one and two, but we're not ignoring stage three. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  37:27 So where I was going with this flow. You need this, you need this, you need this, and you need in CPQ, other stuff as well that we spoke about. Basically, you still need to build your experience. It's not that you can live without experience. Now, there are two ways to do that. One, CPQ builds its own, something that they're doing on their CPQ does this on its own. They don't care about BCS, let's say, hypothetically. Then stage three of CPQ does it on for me and your peak, let's say, or your Shapiro. What I'm telling you is stage three. Forget about roadmap as engineering roadmap, what is to be built. Think of the outcomes I need here. The outcomes I need is to facilitate the commerce of CPQ or through roadmap what we have. But if I break it down into outcomes, these are the outcomes I need, and if I map it to stage one and stage two. These are the same outcomes I need. So basically, what it means is I can start building my architecture. I can start building my intersections, and organise a team to deliver exactly the roadmap, but with a lens that I unlock stage one, stage\n\nSpeaker 2  38:37 two as well. Does it? Does it enhance stage three. I mean, does it make we're not doing anything kind of foundational on stage three. It's just a better pattern, isn't it? You can say that do no do no harm is the first thing, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  38:58 No harm. But would you call saving a harmful off later that's going to come later as a benefit? Yeah, it is definitely, that's what it is.\n\nSpeaker 2  39:09 I think there's a there's an easy thing to digest, though, whi",

    "content": "h is the road maps currently deliver stage three. We're focusing on stage one and stage two to build tender for life, but stage one and state, but everything we do for stage one and stage I'd love to be able to go, here's an example of what we do with experiences or with BCS. Excuse me, that helps stage three. That's the bit. I'm not sure we necessarily need it. It was just your point around. Well, it also helps stage three. So maybe that's something about\n\nSpeaker 1  39:46 that is one way can we flip it and say our core roadmap is to deliver stage three, but we are taking the elements from that stage three and reorganising it around this battle, which is the worker pattern, let's say so that we unlock stage one and stage two through that, rather than saying we're going to build stage one stage two, which is going to make me feel like there is additional work, but we are taking that reorganising, that it's nothing. We are not losing anything. Yes, there will be tiny bit of additional work in reorganising, but what we end up having is stage one and stage two for 10% extra cost.\n\nSpeaker 2  40:26 What I want to do is, I think that's a key part of your you have to make an impact assessment. So one of the slides is, I think we do stage one and stage two, but I think stage three is the the organisational ally. Organisational elegance that you've just talked about, right, which is, we're doing something and it doesn't have So stage one and two, you're going to cover,\n\nUnknown Speaker  40:56\n\nand then then three,\n\nUnknown Speaker  41:01 your is kind of, you're leveraging,\n\nSpeaker 2  41:07 yeah, you're leveraging, you're leveraging what we have already going on in stage three in a way that it's not, you've got to make that point. It's not new. This is kind of organisational focus. There is going to be some marginal effort, but this is, this is internal\n\nUnknown Speaker  41:29\n\ncoordination, not\n\nSpeaker 1  41:32 Greenfield, yeah, yes, not Greenfield, yes, yeah, to make sure that everything goes through, let's say BCS. Those kind of things like more focus on architectural purity, that'll unblock our stage one, stage two.\n\nSpeaker 2  41:48 You know what this means? That this also means that, like, in the end, you're in the NPRs, right? Monthly product reviews, yeah. NPR, yeah. This feels like it's gonna become its own section.\n\nUnknown Speaker  42:06\n\nLet's see. I'm not\n\nUnknown Speaker  42:09 gonna count the chickens this year,\n\nSpeaker 2  42:12 because if it, if we get it across, yeah, it will become its own section. But what I would has been going to deliver platform otherwise. I mean, platform is just a word right\n\nSpeaker 1  42:22 now, monetization platform, or composability and all those things, that's\n\nSpeaker 2  42:26 just word because there's not a single person I've spoken to. There's nothing that says we're coordinated enough to deliver platform.\n\nSpeaker 1  42:34 Nobody's incentivized to do that either. Because the moment you say that, hey, you got 15 dependencies, the other people are like, Okay, I'll take your 15 and raise my 25 Yeah. Now when you bring with this, you're like, hey, l, you are only focused on that piece. Forget about dependencies. The intersection team is going to deliver to you. If they don't, then I get it that you're failing intersection team. This is what you live and die by.\n\nSpeaker 2  43:00 So, yeah, the beauty of this is that if they don't buy the first part of the story, which is like, is, like I said, vendor for life is now being used. But everything that's in Ken's roadmap is about complex. CPQ is about complexity. So it doesn't really have any join this is\n\nSpeaker 1  43:22 because that he doesn't need it. Payment is a payment, right? Billing, you can argue, I don't need commitments for the lighter weights, okay, don't use it. Then your reference architecture,\n\nSpeaker 2  43:34 all right. Well, listen, either either buying platform or they're not.\n\nUnknown Speaker  43:40\n\nSo no,\n\nSpeaker 1  43:42 you probably need an exercise to bring Shakir, Satish, Earl and Fred across this thing.\n\nSpeaker 2  43:48 Well, in principle, all the interviews that I've done so the only, the only did, the only word of caution from Shakir is you have to fix CPQ, like the main stuff, the old CPQ. He wants a liquid paint on the old CPQ.\n\nSpeaker 1  44:10 That's a separate you can't touch that. Yes, I let it go in a separate stream on, yeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2  44:16 So that's the only the unboon is. The only other word, of course, is don't, you know, don't not give me B to B complex, which is fine. We understand everybody else is on board. And Manfred even went so far as to he kind of made me think differently. We use these labels of B to B, plg and B to B, SLG. Actually, all it is is self serve to sales lead. There's no such thing, because you're not either be to be plg or SLG. It's a spectrum. And in fact, what I'm seeing now is people are going from sales led to set back to self serve.\n\nUnknown",

Then we have next gen CPQ, right, which is presumably the thing that supersedes CP well, doesn't supersede it gives it gives it gives us something else to sell, standalone CPQ, etc. So I suspect that that intersection, that's a core part of what the intersection is, because if you have a standalone CPQ, then you should be able to do different things with it.

This is what sits on global methods that people can access out of Salesforce, APIs, UI, and then you got some data model and metadata, sure what I want to do in cpqx, forget about it. So this is what we are not having if I look at CPQ if I just condense it and just take it up the level, I have global methods, have UI, I have services primarily in Salesforce, data model and metadata. What is it that we don't have? We don't support deal lists. We don't support deal scoring, deal two more possible seeking, agentic or agentic. Code builder, for me is white coding, right?

Move everything here. If you see, these are the parts that need to be done as what you call intersections. Right goals, seeking, deal test, deal scoring, deal room. These are fundamental components of that. CRM adapter, fundamental component. But these things are either in platform or intersection. Doc generation should be same as invoice. Doc generation, metadata management should be our central metadata repository approval. Management has to be a platform feature for product solution, configured products. These are like, how do we develop those things? Right? That's what I was saying, that this is what next gen is not an application that sits outside the CPQ. Next Gen is the overall next generation of what CPQ should be. Is it being designed like that. I designed it like that, initially separate to me.

I'll bring in the flow orchestrator product discovery for a selected product, and then maybe I'll bring an add on products, and then I'll bring the finalisation, okay, I don't need to go through too many discounts, recommendation checks and all that.\n\nUnknown Speaker  7:05 Great. Tell me something about orchestrator is,\n\nSpeaker 1  7:09 again, I'm still learning. But if I think about we just said, the assumption there is, there are baked in flows and CPQ, yes, that I can't get out of right? If I don't need them, I can't go around them. That is basically\n\nSpeaker 2  7:26 you decompose it so that you leave it to users. The word I use was recipes. You give some recipes, but then people can compose it as they want. Correct. That is at least where I was going. It is not going there, which is why people are why people are coming back to me now, and I haven't dug into why. What they have done is they have taken my DSLs and documents, and they're saying, now the target right now is we have to stand up a CPQ, all these things will come later, like, Okay, right now I'm not recording it. Yeah, look, if I'm doing a charge of something, then I will dig deeper. But right now, they're coming as questions, and I don't want to jump on\n\nSpeaker 1  8:14 anyone's toes. I have little knowledge of CPQ at this stage, right? But even I can articulate what you wrote, This means it doesn't, doesn't, doesn't take. I been thinking about it like this, take experiences, put a wrap on. I mean, I spoke to Paris, and they said, what we want is they're only gonna send me the doc on Monday.

Or how, you know, this\n\nSpeaker 2  9:19 is the overall vision, how we were going to build it. There's a DSL behind it, all of those things. And there's dependency as well. For example, argument layout manager is not something that I was going to say that build the components, and you want us to build the components except, but that's experiences, that's experiences, the API, that's it.

Are they two very different things,\n\nSpeaker 2  11:39 very close question, because you can argue that ultimately a rule can have a flow as well, or a chain as well, but I consider we have to draw a line.

For example, if I say these two guys need a product browsing experience, the fact that I need to make product browsing guided or not guided is up to me. I have to make a product browsing experience such that I'm not coding the integrations here and here, I'm coding it here. And then this guy says, hey, I want to put a wrapper on it that is guided selling or a filter based that's where the context comes in. If I'm in the CPU context, the experience should be smart enough to adapt. That's real engineering to me. That's real product building.

That is\n\nSpeaker 2  13:37 my platform, or intersections, as you call it, intersection. I look at all of this, I, you know, take a filter, so to speak, in the real world, filter at all.

I did that.\n\nSpeaker 1  14:50 So that is a pattern that we follow as a company, that individual product teams will say, I want to do this thing without validating from the other team,\n\nSpeaker 2  15:00 we do things that are repeated in Zohar. How many ratings do we have? We have legacy rating, which was embedded within billing. Then we did active rating, then we did ACB, then we bought tow guy and thought, We'll do another rating.

Let's say, let's put the user here, or user or interactions. These are interactions. When the interaction comes, wherever it goes, doesn't matter. It goes here, here, or it goes here,\n\nUnknown Speaker  15:56 right? All the interactions carry some data with it,\n\nSpeaker 2  16:00 and that data to me when it starts is context, and actually context to start with has nothing but session information.

Billing will be triggered.\n\nSpeaker 1  17:41 This is, this is the vendor for life story, yeah. What it means is, is that, because, because my account is an abstraction of, well, you have to have billing to have my account, right? You have to have a subscription, so that that's connected, but you, but the experience is configurable, so that is has the flexibility. Well, my account, Subscriber Portal, actually the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 2  18:06 They can be same thing. They can live out. Yeah, Subscriber Portal and my account, I I separate it out, because sometimes you are only giving the access to some capabilities are different. You may put them together, my account has the capability for me to see my billings, my payments, my payment methods, stuff like that, my account hierarchy. But when I go to Subscriber Portal, are you giving me read only access? Are you letting me buy things as well, or are you saying you can manage as well? Like, for example, you have a subscription? Can I upgrade, downgrade?\n\nSpeaker 1  18:39 I think it should be. I think the idea is that components just consume APIs and travel APIs. Yes.

So if I say my Commerce experience has two parts to it. One is registered, another is unregistered users. But for the registered user, once you get in there, you will be able to see my account. You will be sending subscriptions. And technically, these two are subset of the full\n\nSpeaker 1  19:17 commerce right when we when you think about commerce experience. How do you define that?

Yeah, I don't think commerce experience has anything to do with catalogue. Got it. Catalogue is just it happens to be a service that commerce experience uses just like it will use context, just like it will use someday. Billing doesn't make it tightly coupled with catalogue. So experience is literally making sure you have landed on the website. I have nothing to do with you landing on it. Once you have landed, I display the products I recommend, I price, I can allow you to configure if you want this product and that product within the guardrails. ",

So there will be some rules.\n\nUnknown Speaker  20:49 Just talking about rules, the\n\nSpeaker 1  20:55 rules seems to live in a few places, right?

I'm open to considering there could be purpose suited specific rule engine for specific purpose as well, and we should be fine with that. For example, if I have to do what Errol calls merchandising rules, where a couple of products together can be built together or not upgrade, downgrade rules for that, I may use a different rule engine or constraint engine, then I would use for pricing rules, because pricing rules may be simple that if this, this, this are in this set, then this is a price. Or if you added another product, give 10% discount to all the products. Those kind of rules are different. This is very much mathematical. You're not doing any semantic matching or anything in that, whereas in merchandising, it's much more relationship driven where you bought this product that product, but you can't buy this product, and if this is set up, then you are eligible to bundle it together. Okay, sure. What happens if you downgrade, you can't downgrade, or it should increase your price. Those are more complicated rules, and I believe those need something better than rules,\n\nSpeaker 1  24:13 but that's, that's already in arrows roadmap, right? Yeah, the merchandising rules, yeah. So that's\n\nSpeaker 2  24:19 we haven't figured out. What do we use, but that is in the roadmap. That's why I keep on telling him stay away from what should we use? You can always talk, but he's very much deep into that as well that, hey, let's use this. Let's use dmn, let's use DSL. But yeah, that has to be figured out. That's also intersection.

Otherwise, we'll keep on building our own rule engine everywhere, not really what I want.\n\nSpeaker 1  24:49 So does the does that rule engine touch the rule again?

Let's say\n\nSpeaker 2  26:07 I'm a large customer Microsoft coming to Zuora, and I say, look, I want to build my own setup that I want. I want billing, but I don't want, let's say you giving me rating. Take out rating. You have to have rating. Now, hypothetically in revenue, I don't need SSP, so you would bend over backwards to get some of those customers into the configuration. For those we can argue that we will not take such customer such requirements, we'll remove it. But if we have that, then those kind of rules will come in and affect CPQ as well. It's dynamic product configuration.\n\nUnknown Speaker  26:43 Well, CPQ light would use that.\n\nUnknown Speaker  26:46 I don't think the CPQ light should use that. Why\n\nSpeaker 1  26:50 isn't?

But who would use CPQ light? Well, I'm coming from that angle. The customers, the businesses that are going to use CPU like probably don't want that complexity either. They want it's pre built. Let me just sell it, guys, I'm at that stage. That's all I need. When you get complicated. That's where that theory about intersection and Lego blocks comes in, that I have a Lego block that is product configuration. You don't have to move from CPQ light to enterprise totally you get that Lego block. But at some stage, there's a tipping point you have one more Lego block. You might as well have Enterprise. You know, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  27:32 Also it's that. It's that join between I am I have an SLG motion, or I have a sales assisted but I actually want more self serve as our customer. We don't want so many sales people. Yeah, some of these deals just don't need a sales person in the mix. And if we had just, we have, if we had that configuration, then maybe we could do that.

I wouldn't even, I'm not even brave enough to re engineer arrows, but his road maps BCS. I mean, he's got BCS of road map items.

Wonder why, BCS 5050, and whether it should be part of the acquisition team.\n\nSpeaker 2  31:53 Okay, I do not know what all teams you have set up now. So, okay, so far, I don't so if I was in my old role, the way I would do the presentation is, look, I'm going to set a picture, but I'm going to take you there. So usually people start from a bigger picture, go to smaller one, but I'm going to start from smaller because that's what you know. So I'm going to start you have gotten this today. We have released this much. This is where we're going tactically. Which is where BCS blah, blah, blah comes in. This is where CPQ comes in. Hello. This is where Zephyr unification comes in, acquisition comes in. So first 510 minutes, you won't understand a lot, fine, but at least I have given you enough information that you like, Oh, my God, that's a lot of work. But then you come to them so that now they can appreciate and say, Actually, let's condense it and see what is it as a customer that I should get? Then you present the bigger picture, and then you say, now what I'm seeing, what we have seen through all of this, is there are relencies in there, there are dependencies in there. This is never going to work unless we start from this picture down. So tactically, we will not stop people, but in next two to three months, we'r",

You and I. There's no daylight between them. So yeah. So how do we get what would you because the so you you've articulated a few times you said, Listen, I kind of can this is the right thing to do. I can see the right thing to do. But then, you know, someone changes job and goes under a different department, or a product moves with them, and I can see exactly why it was. And just go too many loops to jump through, no coordination. So coordination, intersection as a roadmap, is the central theme of what I'm talking about, which is exactly what you're proposing, what you've kind of been trying to do. So I think it makes sense to say, Listen, this is the architect. What I want to land on is I want to say, Listen, this is how we see intersection now. Now it's going to go down to 1000 feet. And just talk about why intersection is possible, because the bit that people are going to vote. So if you, if you could execute it with a mandate from me to say that's we agree as partners, we agree what this thing is. You I get to this kind of point, 10,000 feet or whatever, and say, Listen, I can see this. Now. It's going to take us down here a little bit so that the engineers in the room can see it. This is a proposal, and what I want, what I'm really looking for from this is for Pete and Shakir to endorse it or not. If they don't endorse it, I don't want to waste my time on it, but if they endorse it, then it feels like this is a meaty piece of what the next year should look like, because one of the slides that I've got is on our go to market. If you talk to Boone, I've spoken to all of them. Boone Paulo Baptist, who's the GM of Amir mark, gagne and Darren Johnson, all of them have a different view about what is we'll have a different view about what the go to market is. Now I'm says B to B. Complex. Darren wants B to C. He's the global VP of sales. He wants everything. Paulo Baptista, 60% of his business is not B to B complex, of course. Mark gagne is B to any Yeah. So between us, when I said to Shaquille, that's the situation, he said, Well, reality is, you build for now and everyone else gets the scraps. Well, that's fine, right?

We can, we can wrap it to a point where you are ready to synthesise, yeah, yeah, right. Totally appreciate that. I think one thing I did think about, and I do agree what you said, you made a statement to me that it has to start from what do we want to be, the overarching strategy, because then people relate to that, and then you say, To achieve this, we got to bring something like this in play. You cannot start with this. We want this, which is a mistake I have made. I think so, because I come from that background, the storytelling has to start. Look, this is what our customers want, and variety of customers to unblock all of this. We need something like this. And then you go into this is how the teams will be",

That's what makes one thing function against the other thing that's already catchy. You know, everyone I mean, I can shape with Satish, and I will get into the room and say, You really think you need to do that, or, how do we do that? But this is foundational. So I think that where you and I get to is that I'm gonna, I want to get to a kind of a first principles view, like this is kind of what we're talking about here. What's the first principle as a product owner, leader, whatever I see this as I buy this, right? I've articulated this to now. Now has played it back to me. We have two different lenses. I've played this up to the rest of the business. Everybody agrees. I mean, there's not a single person that disagrees, by the way, the only counter argument. The strongest counter argument is from boom that says, I want to sell what we've got, 100% right, right? I need CPQ. I need better CPQ. I need more stuff in billing. That's big to be complex. No problem with that. We don't touch that a lot of that was with Ken and so what I'd love to do is get to a first principles view and then say, Okay, now it's gonna now take us down to 1000 feet, yeah, and when, when?

I mentioned it twice, and then what's going to happen is we're going to land up in dependency hell, right? Because so I talk in the in my document about insulation of the roadmap. You have to insulate people, to let them deliver the thing that Shakira you and I have got this very nuanced pattern, which is, how do we build an intersection and not just create a list of additional roadmap items and roadmap that's the that's,\n\nUnknown Speaker  41:05 I think, because we'll never get it done\n\nSpeaker 2  41:07 otherwise, yeah, because the way I'm trying to picture that is that team that you're envisioning, I feel it's like a team now intersection or a team.

We can probably see what people say after this. I have a feeling people would say yeah, but that's what you said. We'll say Yes, exactly. We can continue to build that. So I will not say that the room that look your organisational structure came in the way. But this is the first time, probably having all these things consolidated now helps.\n\nSpeaker 1  42:07 We only have one shot at this, really. The reason we have one shot is because, and I'm dancing a very fine line, because what I realised in my deck today, which I had to pare it back, is there was a there. Was a, there was an implicit criticism. I hadn't really picked it up until I read the deck again. It's an implicit criticism of the way the organisation is structured, right?

That is the first principles view. It seems like BCS, zems, it's the block at the bottom. So I guess to some degree we need to refine this.\n\nSpeaker 2  44:33 We can just try to do that contention.

We can meet during the day tomorrow, but I think we'll be good then.\n\nSpeaker 2  45:01 So there are various ways to approach it. The way I would approach it is interaction centred. Let's say everything starts with interactions. And we have users, which is like we call c2 end user. We got types of c1 as well. Good. And tomorrow, what I want is some agent, a communication as well. We'll come to that too later. Okay, so we're gonna standardise terminology. Everything that niche is here is an interaction. Yeah, right. So this is my interaction somewhere. Interaction needs to be captured this. This has some data associated with it, right? So I'm going to say this data goes to my context manager. You call it BCS, or you call it context manager, but there is a context manager.\n\nSpeaker 1  45:51 So the first concept is that whatever BCS is understood to be today explodes out to capture all of our context, all context.\n\nSpeaker 2  46:02 Yes, this is session, plus your context, and also enrichment and action of that as well. I shared a document with Alan, more than happy to share with you as well.

This is going to shape what acquisition is, because if, if Alan, for example, owned, well, all right, we'll, we'll put places to this, just to give some people an org structure, but go on case we have a context layer, right, correct?\n\nSpeaker 2  47:12 So here, once I have registered the context, then I need to decipher, what do you want to do, the action, right? So interaction will have an action. Now, the actions can be multiple. I do not know how many actions could there be. I mean, I know. So for for example, we can have product browsing. That is one of the actions I can perform. Or you can say this is kind of an interaction itself, but, yeah, this is one two is going to be check out. So going to be payment somewhere. Four could be cancellation, upgrade, download, amendments. Let's group it in amendments so these kind of actions can happen,\n\nUnknown Speaker  47:54 which is why there can be end list of actions.\n\nSpeaker 2  47:59 That's why I need a broker over here, and that broker needs to understand where should I go from here? For example, for product browsing, I need to go to this guy. For something else, I need to go\n\nUnknown Speaker  48:11 somewhere else. This layer does not exist today. The\n\nSpeaker 2  48:14 orchestration layer of the action breakage doesn't so because people call the API directly from here, right?

All of this is\n\nUnknown Speaker  49:01 experiencing just an abstraction of API,\n\nSpeaker 2  49:04 just like this guy, right?

You go start doing something. When you do something, the broker has to come in. Let's not call it intelligent experience. This is, let's say, orchestrator or something that makes more sense to me. Okay, so it's a broker, yeah, that can then route to, where should I go? Yeah, because behind the scene, I may have multitude of things. I may be executing an audit. I may be executing something else. It's basically literally\n\nSpeaker 1  50:06 today at the action, there's this kind of linear flow, or that there's this direct relationship with the API. What you're saying is that in order to abstract this into this kind of strategy, where you have to have this broker in the middle that can understand that the context, understand the action, and then route to the right place.

You do not have a better way of it. That's why I was very much. I had a stance on this, that this job of building what an action means should be outside plasma. It should just outsource to that. That's what I wanted experience. Experience cannot be making\n\nUnknown Speaker  51:32 this again. This is the intersection.\n\nSpeaker 2  51:34 So right now is here I get it.

This is simple product browsing, but technically, I did the same in commerce experiences. I did the same everywhere else. So I'm saying next gen don't wear this. That's why we have something called a flow orchestrator. If you have a product browsing flow, I have done all of this, you just use it. You do not have to redevelop it. If you want to skin on this. Then he goes with experiences guy, and go there and shop for a virgin if you don't have it, that's okay if you don't have it. Then ask these guys, you need to give it to me. Or Guess what?

This is an anti pattern to that, which is, yes, you're building as a as a service, as a platform, and just trying to find the consumer of that of though, you know, as you say, I think the idea of an interaction or a context manager that's greater than just the c1 or C, either one of those things, is powerful.\n\nSpeaker 2  56:29 Basically, this becomes part of my context, and now I know what experience I need to render. I don't like the word layout manager, the term that I use their layout manager, but it's more like an experienced manager, right? What should I display to you? So this, this guy over here, this guy over here, this, this, these are all part of the platform. Even pricing engine I want to it is already part of,\n\nSpeaker 1  56:56 let's not call it platform. If we have a platform team, it's part of the interactions team or the intersection team or whatever. Yeah, just tell me about guided selling. Then what I was\n\nSpeaker 2  57:06 going on about guided selling. What happens here is a c1 starts the journey, or a c1 prime like I'm selling for to you on behalf of Zora administrator.

But in Zora, or, let's say, in zoom, I may change it. I may say I don't care about base I want you to select first the platform, then I want to select a communication service, then I want to select a modern or something like that, right? So this guided selling journey, that the whole journey could be different for me than for anyone else. But what are these? These are actually product browsing experiences only in a string of them with different different different contexts, which I have given you already step one, filter platform. Step two, filter what you selected, platform, platform with the help of that, filter communication, something like that. So these things are what I believe our advanced experiences should be able to handle, rather than CPQ building it. So CPQ today will build something to support it\n\nUnknown Speaker  58:42 natively. Well, the the argument\n\nSpeaker 1  58:44 for that is the product browsing is not a unique experience. It is. It's an experience that\n\nUnknown Speaker  58:55 a C but c2 might have\n\nSpeaker 2  58:57 correct, yeah, because now we have the understanding of the context we should be able to render and re render these things at will, and hence we can provide, maybe we can provide a visual library.\n\nSpeaker 1  59:10 Okay, so I'm sure there's more.

And you can take a customer, we have the capability to take a customer from 50 million to a billion, right? We can do that like someone just has to focus on it. But the bits of what I wanted to wanted to do, because this is CPQ light story is like, we, I'll tell you, we have a few things going on. We've got kind of cpqx, which, you know, we've got next gen CPQ which is like, what it's, what it says, like, bit of AI on it, fairy dust, improved capabilities, better analytics, all that kind of stuff. And then we got another thing which I can't talk about, which is happening. So there's a few flavours, but the most, the thing that I'm trying to get to in this call is this, if you think about vendor for life, take a met and just give me two minutes to give you the story. If you take a med tech company like 50 million, and we get, I think we get too hung up with B to B, plg and SLG, right? It's like they're arbitrary boundaries. So let's just talk about the customer. Customer comes in, they're small, they go through some kind of qualification journey, which is run by Zora acquisition. You know what? What? You know you from gov.uk, or you've not, are you? You know what's your, what's the size of the company, you interested in software or hardware, that kind of thing. So there's this kind of qualification engine, which or which Zephyr can handle. And you get to a point where customer goes, Okay, so what should you know? What's the right thing for me? And the qualification can be more complex than that, but it's all self service. And they get to a trial. Let's say they're buying software. Our hardware is obviously different. They're buying software and they get to a trial, they do something.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:56 Jonathan, do you mind if we put on AI companion",

So they, so they get to this journey, or they get to the end of this thing, and they, they, they, then they get into a trial, and they're okay, right? So it's all self service. Then at some point they go, actually, I kind of need this. I'm not sure if it's a service rep or a sales rep, but I need a little bit of something else, right? There's just something over at the edge. And maybe they do, maybe they and again, they self Configure. They get, they ask a question, do I need this or this? And they do a little bit of tweaking, and then they get to the thing that they want, right? So they're happy then, like, maybe, I don't know, six months or 12 months down the line, they go, Oh, I've got my first enterprise customer, right? Or, you know, I kind of, I need something a bit bigger. And they go, I don't need full blown CPQ, because we're not that complex, but I need something I can self configure, right? This is what I call CPQ light. It's like I've got some levers, some some I don't need all the compliance in there. I just need to configure a quote that I can then send to a customer. I don't want to do it in a spreadsheet. I just want to do it in something that helps me deliver, you know, really something quite quick. I don't have a lot of sales people, maybe even the CPO or the chief executive officer does it himself, and he sends out a quote that's CPQ light. Then he gets a few other sales people, and they using CPQ light. But then actually, they get to a number, 500 million of sales, and then they are like, well, actually, you know, and that's where the billing light thing comes in. And then they get to bigger, and then they need full blown CPQ or, or they've got 10 sales people, they need some compliance rules in there. And, and the story goes on right? And then they get big, and they need complex. Then they become a more complex business. So that's and the complex is where we start, and 50 million is where we don't start. But what I'm selling internally, and I'll shut up in a sec is we have CPQ catalogue experiences and acquisition, right? There's lots of services around those things, but the customer doesn't give a shit, right? They care about the story I just told, and the story is at the intersection of those capabilities, those products. That's how the customer sees us. Can I use an experience with CPQ that sits on top of catalogue that isn't that complex, you know? Can I use a set can I manage? Can I do a journey flow that has an experience at the end of it, and that's all they care about. So that's, that's what our customer that B to any, you know, it's B to B. Could be B to any, but B to B, what we call plg, self serve, all the way up to sales assisted. So the bit we're talking about today, and number one, you know, it's not, maybe an ill formed story, but that's, do you agree with that hypothesis? Kind of what we're doing the Clarice workshop on right, 50 mil to a billion. That's the story I want to build out. But secondly is the point positioning of what we call CPQ light. And I use that term loosely, right? So I'm going to pause there and ask and leave those two",

    "content": " questions with you.\n\nSpeaker 2  5:20 Yeah, because I guess, like, you already have Zora, CPQ, let's just forget that for a second. What I was thinking is, like you said, you can have, like a standalone thing, which is, I guess, some kind of life element of Zora, like you have to go into Zora or not TBD, but then you could work out a way of integrating that into Salesforce, or other sales application as well. But I think at the moment, you definitely don't necessarily need to worry about that, because you could just iframe it, to be honest, and then you need the API to send the data back to Salesforce like it doesn't have to be a, like, fully immersive experience in Salesforce, so, yeah, you could design it basically like it's a standalone thing that creates a quote. I think probably you need to think about some of the small customers who won't be so fussed about Salesforce. Might still want that quote to be signed, like, I agree to this quote. So there's some other functionality in there. I think it's not just add a bunch of products, tell me a price. You might need some like, add special terms, or like, a signature block type thing, and think about sending to E sign but yeah, I think that's good, because you'll get immediately, get a traction with customers. You don't really do CRM, like, instantly. So all of the plg firms are like, well, I should probably start doing sales instantly. Could just start using that.\n\nSpeaker 3  6:37 It makes a lot of sense to me as well, because a lot of the power, actually, of cpqx isn't necessarily the deep, complex functionality you can drive. It's the it's an integration there. And you can, for the enterprise. You don't begin to press customers, you can say, well, you don't need to build an integration into XOR if you use cpqx, because it's pre built for you. And I think that's what, again, the Big B to B, big B to C, enterprise levels will already probably have a very complex e commerce platform, which they're more than happy to integrate into a Zora. But it's the, like you said, it's 50 to kind of 200 million, which will often say to us, what can Zora do? We say, basically anything. And they say, but how in the front end? Oh, we need to build an E commerce platform. And that just ends the conversation. So I think the power of like a CPQ light that could be rendered into a front end, like web page or E commerce platform, user facing experiences that it offers that integration into Zora and in a light, lightweight model, so they can just get started really quickly and not have to build a really complex, complex orchestration to use or as the back end. And I think you're right in that the next step of that would be to almost have the billing lighter weight as well for that journey of growing the organisation. So you can start with a lighter weight billing, with a lighter weight CPQ on their front end, and then they can grow into more of the full billing, and then they can potential",

But it does seem like that 50 200 million is where customers will often go to the competitors who can't offer as much, but they can offer it easier.\n\nSpeaker 1  8:17 Yeah, I think that's a very good summary. And I The interesting thing about when you think about CPQ, light and or billing, is we think about the the the there are two parts to the platform, to this, to each of those products. One is the front end, one is the back end, right? So the back end does anything the front end, someone just chose to represent everything in that way, right? So it's like, you go into a candy store and all the sweets are all over the floor, instead of they're all in very discrete buckets, and you just go to the bucket that you want, right? And you and you build your bag in the way that you want to build it. And what I'm thinking is and what I want to get to is a definition of what CPQ Lite is, which I think Tom you touched on, and Matt, you were kind of alluding to there is that\n\nUnknown Speaker  9:14\n\nyou just count Jonathan,\n\nSpeaker 1  9:16 sorry, what I was saying is that what I wanted to get to was, did I did? I give the sweet store analogy,\n\nUnknown Speaker  9:23 you cut a definition, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  9:26 So the definition of what CPQ light is, right? So, like, I think we have to be precise. So I billing light, I think is another conversation. But let me just tell you how I think we get to CPQ light. First of all, if I go to the product leaders and what I'm selling internally is don't fuck with the product leaders, right? They know what they're doing. Insulate them, right? Don't do an immediate media on them, like insulin. Don't sell them. What's not there, right? Because we spent all of our time at the intersection, not at the products, right? So we spent a lot of time at the intersection. Don't sell an intersection that's not there, right? So insulate the product leaders, but let them go and build all the capabilities, right? That's what they're good at. They've got 30 years experience. They know what that that Manfred knows what he's doing. Errol knows what he's doing, right? So that's all fine. Those are our internal product leaders, but let's say you get, you get a sales team where you get Clarisse, and you go, well, actually, I don't need all of that right now for this customer, we have this experiences layer. And the experiences layer is both an external and an internal facing tool, right? So if I want to build a My Account page, you know when experience with the experiences thing would have made your lives a billion times easier with with immediate right? It is highly configurable. Yeah, anything you want to do you can do inside this new experience, completely different story. But my thing is, well, why don't we just take the things that you want in a CPQ light and abstract them away through the experiences layer, right? So it looks more sassy than enterprise. Do you know what I mean? It's like you just, why do you need to even touch the CPQ product? You just go, Listen, that's the CPQ product. Is just a front end that interacts with a bunch of API's. Yes, that's it. So, you know, ",

But could you not just almost extract the how you add subscription or how you set up price plans and add subscriptions in Zorro, extract that, and then we basically made the UI a bit better. So I guess we can do the storyboard of like what a salesperson is likely to do, but in the same way, I want to add this amount of these products, this product's a usage product. I want to add a cap, like, what's the maximum we've got\n\nSpeaker 1  12:06 to match. We've got all of that. We've got the engine lives there, right? But what we've got in experiences is these components, right? And you can build a component to do anything, everything that you said, I can build a component for right? So I can put a team of people, and I can say, see that thing there. Give me that page that is CPQ light. And they go in, and they go, okay, CPQ team. I want to consume that. I want to consume that, and I want to consume that. And that's the sweetie shop, okay? And then you go, actually, what we want is a signature block, okay? Or we want this, or whatever that is, yeah? And we go, yeah, okay, we didn't build that. We'll go off and build that now, right? And that's like a two or three day job, because it all exists. The back end exists. You just need to put a wrapper on it. So I think what I want to try and sell again, as a further extension of this is, well, what does CPQ light look like? That's what. Hey, this is our partner, clarissis. That's what they said it looks like. Then I go to the product guy, and I say, all of that stuff exists, right? And he goes, Yeah, that will exist. So I go, Okay, now that, because what I'm saying is we have another product in our business that no one knows about, and it's called the intersection, right? Someone just has to focus on cerebral well, it, but that's it. But think about it. What does the customer buy? Is the intersection? That's the that's the customer journey, right? So the intersection is taking experiences and the CPQ back end and creating CPQ light for a vendor, for a partner like you. And then you go, yeah, we know. No problem. We can build CPQ live. We actually built, we could actually build it for you. It's got this stuff out of the box. You want another thing, no problem. We know how to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2  14:08 Yeah, nice, because this kind of would get us on to, like, what's in it for us. Ideally, it would be nice to have exclusivity, but doesn't have to quite get that far in, like, when customers want it, like we're the implementation partner, or we help it should be set up, right? And stuff like that. So, yeah, that would be good.\n\nSpeaker 1  14:30 I can get you a demo. I can get you a demo from the product owner, right, guy called Jimmy Coniston, and you'll, you'll immediately see where you live, because you'll go, well, CPQ light doesn't ha",

So I've spoken to everyone across Sora that everyone's buying this, right?\n\nUnknown Speaker  15:31\n\nThe product org, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  15:35 So what I would love is, I would love to say, and listen. So, so, you know, I pitched this up to clariss, who's a implementation, part of us in Europe. And and when I said, Well, you know what, CPQ Lite, they kind of came back with this really simple page and said, well, actually, here's like, five things. Like, we call that six things, or whatever it is, just one page and it looks like they want it to look okay? And I said, well, listen, we can make a decision, should it always look like Zora, or can it be because of experiences? It can always be whatever the customer wants, you know, but the idea of you build it and you drop it right into something else, that's the principle. But the story is, if experiences doesn't have, if the if the intersection isn't the product I CPQ and experiences, then you can't do that thing. But yeah, the end. So the I'm selling you the intersection between those two capabilities. So if you gave me a and I say, this is what they want. And I know that the capability is there in experiences, and I know the capability is there in CPQ. So you tell me why we can't have billing a CPQ light. Yes, that. So that's my ask, is if I could get one thing with five widget, whatever basic it can be, look, it can look shit. It doesn't matter. It, honestly, it just something, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2  17:06 full disclosure, we're obviously not UI designers.\n\nSpeaker 1  17:09 No, no, no. It's not. It's not. No, no. I don't want to UI. I want, I want squares on a on a screen, right? If you go, hey, I want this over here, and it's got these fields in it. You could even just put a, I don't know, PowerPoint slide together that's got a very rudimentary there'd be a block up here, there'd be something over here. So it's basically when Matt wakes up in the morning and thinks about CPQ, right? Most mornings, yeah, most mornings it's like in your mind, what is CPQ like to you? It just has to be nothing more than that, because what I want to do is connect the dots between, oh, we've got an experiences which is super flexible over here, and we've got a CPQ back end over here. So why can't I have CPQ light, right? Why do I have to? Why do I have to wait for next gen CPQ to land which has got everything in it, yeah, the 100 million dollar just going to sales assisted growth doesn't need that. Doesn't need all the bells and whistles. Just needs the thing that Matt wants them to have.\n\nUnknown Speaker  18:20 That makes, makes sense. Yeah, I\n\nUnknown Speaker  18:22 think that's good. I mean,\n\nSpeaker 2  18:25 obviously the sky's the limit, so we will have, we'll do some absolute we could, what we could do is absolutely core, and then just some ideas of additional things that we would need. And obviously we'll go Agile on it, right? And you can build some of that stuff over time, but it'll be good that you can see some future stuff as well as just the simple stuff now to make the coast.\n\nSpeaker 1  18:45 Because what I would do is I would say, Can I enable clariss as an implement implementation partner? Can I enable the sales team in their go to market? And if I can answer that yes, then that's, that's the story, right? With that. That's and that fee",

    "content": "ls like one of these really simple things to do that just no one's focusing on, and it's an unlock. And then you do the same for billing light, and then you're, then you're telling this, then you've got, you know, Zephyr using experiences. That's the journey up to, you know? So it just makes perfect sense. But all of those are the intersections of the products, not the products themselves.\n\nUnknown Speaker  19:31\n\nYeah, because\n\nSpeaker 1  19:32 then you've got things like, like, Errol's building, who's running catalogue, soft and hard bundles, merchandising rules, you know, really powerful stuff inside the catalogue. CPQ lives on top of the catalogue. So you've got this kind of abstract you've got different layers of abstraction, but it's super powerful.\n\nSpeaker 3  19:54 Is there anything available on the experiences layer at the moment to read on, or is it still in its inception? It?\n\nSpeaker 1  20:04 Well, we have a front we built the front end. We've got all the kind of first principles in place. We're rolling it up inside Zora. I'd be more than happy next week or the week after, to show you a bare bones demo of this thing and what it's it, what you will like is you as an implementation partner can go in, build the experience, but interact directly with the API's in billing, anywhere in billing, and compose anything, right? Anything you want can be composed. So, yeah, I'll arrange that, Matt. I'll get a proper demo done for you.\n\nSpeaker 3  20:49 So it's almost a abstracted layer that sits it interacts directly with the API's, but it's not actually a user facing fit. It's in the\n\nSpeaker 1  21:00 middle, but no the c1 can build our customer can build with it. They can build My Account page. We're going to have a suite of out of the box components, you know, if you think about it, like fully formed things that you can just drop in, but they're also editable. You can build objects from scratch, components from scratch. You can build, you know, a single item that does a very single thing, like, give me the total value of your subscriptions over the last 12 months. So you can put conditional logic into these things. You can build dynamic logic into these things, you can continue. Can Build A container around them so you can drop them in anywhere, so they can live. You could have an, you know, assisted service, for example, I want an agent, and they're in Zendesk, but I want them to have permissions to see the user's account, but they can't see the credit card details. So you can basically do what you like.\n\nUnknown Speaker  22:04\n\nIt's incredibly powerful.\n\nSpeaker 3  22:06 And then the concepts of the CPQ light is that it would almost utilise this componentized functionality to be able to create\n\nSpeaker 1  22:14 that product. And what I think is the boundary is that the CPQ light would have a hard skin on it, which is aura, right? So that when you do go back into Zora, you're not like, whoa. What the fuck is that? Like? I don't know what that is, right? It's, so it's, it's, it's UI, like CSS would be one thing, but its capability would be infinitely extensible to the boundaries of or not infinitely, but extensible to the boundaries of what CPQ does today and in the future. But you don't But what's really interesting is the implementation partner you'd own, what that looks like. It's not like, oh, there's CPQ. Ignore all of that stuff over there. Don't look at all of that that's too much for you. And the customer just goes, sorry, I'm not buying that. You just go, that, see that little thing over there, that thing that's perfect for you. That's exactly what you need right now,\n\nSpeaker 3  23:13 the full features are what they need and what they use. There's no added confusion of Don't, don't, don't, don't click that button, because you click that button, it's going to cancel it at the wrong time. Then you're going to have to do reverse cancellation and all this stuff, because it is exactly built around, tailored around what their actual use case is correct. And what that\n\nSpeaker 1  23:32 means is, Matt, is that the the complexity of this is, are you breaking patterns? Right? If you don't show that thing, does that put you into this kind of Death Loop that you've like, you've broken the you've broken CPQ or something like, you've done something you can never get out of it. So I think it's, it's a careful use. You know, it's like, be careful with that power. But I think the principle is right. And I'd love to say, Listen, this is, I believe the product, org needs stories, and then, hey, we have, here's an intersection, CPQ experiences, that's it. And so it's really easy for everyone to understand what that means. So if you want to put down on paper or jump on a call or whatever you want, but this is a chance for you to shape that like narrative. And then you're then I come to you and say, listen, here's our kind of baseline components. You can go to a customer, when you're doing a bigger implementation, use CPQ as a sharp end to kind of get in and also the extensibility of CPQ, right? So you'll, you'll be able to say, well, you know what, what is the, what are the things I have access to, you know, CPQ, super Well, Matt, and you go, Well, okay, we can, but you don't need to be front end designers. You just build the component tree that's needed to deliver that CPQ light experience.\n\nSpeaker 2  25:06 That would be perfect. Yeah, that's yeah. All right, fine. So from your perspective, ideally. yes. What you mean in terms of enhancements that we would ask or make a Bill Well,\n\nSpeaker 1  25:21 no about billing lights. Why? You know, is there a? I mean, I guess the question is, is there us? Is there a? Is there a world where billing light was always tried this, right? They tried to do billing light, this code in Zora, which is billing light. But if you go to the billing team and say, billing light, you won't. There's nothing, no one's going to buy that. But again, what I'm thinking about is, can you abstract a billing light\n\nSpeaker 2  25:52 product to a customer I got you, yeah.\n\nUnknown Speaker  25:56 Is that? Is that even feasible? Do you think or not?\n\nSpeaker 2  26:01 Yeah, I guess it's just weird, because what will happen is it will be fine being light, and then they'll want something else. So what you're really doing is just masking the features of the full product. I suppose that you only enable features when they request, which you kind of already do in billing today with some things. So make it slightly more extensible.\n\nSpeaker 1  26:20 Tell me where the so.",

    "content": " So there's two problems with anything that Zora does. Number one, implementing billing takes too long, right? So for a $50 million dollar B to B, plg company,\n\nSpeaker 2  26:35 but, but it, yeah, but it doesn't, okay. It doesn't. If you're only configuring simple things, she has make a meal of it. But like, for some of our use cases, you can be doing the config in like three weeks. Matt, four weeks maybe.\n\nSpeaker 1  26:49 So let's pause there. That's what I want to spend some time tell me about that story, right?\n\nSpeaker 3  26:54 Yeah, to put into context, obviously this is not go live ready, but it took me and colleague, Ben Freeman, a day for SSG, and we're ready to demo a new subscription, new account, new payment bills accounted for, rev, rec. So for some businesses, it is very doable to set Zora up extremely quickly. Now there's all the bells and whistles that then around the business processes, like what email should go out when, and what events should happen when, and what other systems do we have to send data to. But the actual core journey of here is a new customer with a contact record, a payment method, and a subscription that's been invoiced, payment has been taken, recognised revenue, and the accounting is ready for the journals that can take a few weeks honestly to get ready if the business is in a position where they can accommodate more of the out of the box functionality, so we can definitely, kind of speak to that story and the types of guardrails that need to be in place for it to be that quick.\n\nSpeaker 1  28:03 Okay, well, so, so that is a an additional, very valuable thing, right? So we've got a team of people, data scientists, working on, how do you take complex businesses from nine month implementations to six week or two, three month implementations? Right? Reference, architecture, LLM driven setups, all of that kind of stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2  28:35 I don't think you need. Like, you're skipping the middle bit, though, of just delivering a project in a different way, which is probably just not using GS, for example. So yeah, you can do all of that. But like at the moment, right? You start getting a project, the customer doesn't really know what their requirements are. You start building some stuff. It's not quite right. You're doing testing, you rebuild stuff, and that whole process takes six months. Basically, that is what happens today, whereas, if you had a better thing, I guess, to your point of reference, architecture, just like we're going to build you either A, B or C, no variations, that's what we will build. Which one would you like? Then you negate all of that sort of back and forth and requirements and testing and stuff. So that's probably more than when you say billing light, it's the and Salesforce do this. It's like pre packaged conflict. So you buy automotive cloud or media cloud or something, and I'll be honest with you, it's a lie, though, that's all configured for you, but that's their sales pitch",

    "content": ", right, that it's all configured faster your business. It's going to work as active as you want it out the box, no problem. That's sort of thing that we could have done with doing or want to do originally with the media, right, where a client doesn't actually know what they need or what the next evolution looks like, just put something in front of them and then tinker and tailor from there, rather than starting grounds up because he's getting to a quagmire of detail they don't understand asking for stuff they don't need. It's a different approach that we wanted to try and make work and meet it, but then they got hung up on nth degree of detail and acceptance criteria and stuff, which compromised it. But the original plan was, we'll just build something that fundamentally works your business model and then tweak from there. So if you've got those kind of reference points of this kind of business, this kind of implementation, and then you kind of retrofit that's gonna be a hell of a lot quicker to something that works. And also, ultimately, look at what ended up having with the media right is you go shooting for the exact thing that they think they want at the start, and they never end up getting it anyway. So why not accelerate towards a thing which is 80% there, and that's your start point, rather than that being your end point? Yeah, because you should do like, LLM config sort of style stuff, like, that's pretty cool. That's a good place to get to. But I think you actually have a way easier route of doing the pre configured thing, and then you don't even need that.\n\nSpeaker 1  30:54 I agree with you. I think that's a very, very good point. So there's a difference between the concept of because CPQ light feels like it should be a configurable thing. It's contained. It's a container of ability capabilities, and you just want to use the capabilities you need, right? It's like pick and mix. But I think you make an extremely good point. Billing is a beast. Billing light feels like you could fall, you could fall over yourself many, many different ways, and never, ever have all of the widgets that you need but reference architecture in the 50 to 100 or 200 mil space, and obviously immediate is bigger than that, but reference architecture is the thing that we should be focused on.\n\nSpeaker 2  31:46 Okay? There's like known there's known key variables, right? So as you start hitting like US tax, that brings a whole load of complexity. The invoice is going to be the same. It's like assume 50 200 million you're selling predominantly into one or two geographies, or you're under certain thresholds. Therefore you don't need to entertain that layer of complexity. That's a really good binary question you can ask a client that either opens or shuts down a whole suite of what exists in billing or doesn't exist in billing. In some instances today we, I mean, Matt, you've probably got a pretty good handle on what the fundamentals are of this means simple. This means hard, and you could get, you could piece together. This is the simple there that should exist within billing, but doesn't today.\n\nSpeaker 1  32:28 I think that would be super helpful, because what's happened now is I run the acquisition, the order, and a guy called Ken Houseman runs, you know, no can order to cash, right? So we believe in the story. I pitched it to him. He believes in the vendor for life story, right? He calls it forever vendor, which sounds a bit like I should have a dragon, some kind of Starry Eyed dragon on the on the cover of that story, but he believes in that. And so what I would love to do is I'd love to go to him and say, Listen, I'm dealing with the CPQ light thing. But why don't we have these three reference implementations? Why, you know, is there something fundamental that we're missing here, because what you just said will makes perfect sense. You've got this, but if you want to open Pandora's box, then we can open it for you. But that's, here's the reference implementation. That's it. So I struggle to understand why that doesn't exist, like and you're a vendor, so if it, if you, if you haven't seen it, it probably doesn't exist, right? But it should now, if that enables and again, this is at the intersection, right? The the reference artist architecture is the inter",

I need some things that connect up with each other, that tell an implementation story, right? So ask me for that. I'll put that up on the screen. I'll speak to Ken before the presentation, and I'll say, you know, we talk about billing light. Billing light, actually, to a vendor like clarissis, means reference implementation, right? Reference Architecture. Here's, here's, here's less complex. Here's middle complex, here's super complex, however you want to represent that, or just make it, make it simple and complex, right? So you just got two things to do, and I'll go, Well, you know, as a as a vendor who's dealing at the intersection of all of our capabilities this map, Matt, who's this guy, says I could get this up in in three weeks or six weeks, or whatever, like not. I think you should get it they they can get it up. That's what they do, right? That unlocks this kind of customer. And then Will, Will says, you know, for the complex stuff, using immediate media, because everybody knows about immediate media. In me, if we'd have had this, it would have been a fundamentally different thing. Now I won't even mention GS, because I'm i I'm buying what you're selling. Tom, right. Difference, that's a different story.\n\nSpeaker 2  35:20 Yes, is purely there for some help if we need it, rather than implementation of any kind.\n\nSpeaker 1  35:26 I agree with you, right? I agree with you. So what I'd love is, this is what Matt says, This is what will says, you know, and what it means is two slides that everyone immediately crystallises the story, rather than me. I don't want to Pitch Anything. I want it. I'm actually bringing all the views up to the business. And you're one of those views, because the other is the differences in Europe. Sorry to interrupt you. Is the difference in Europe is we are, we are partner led like this, right? But in America, it's all i It's all is, is, right? So, so they're, they're totally wedded to B, to B complex SARS. They need a reason for me to force them downstream a little bit. But Europe's already there.\n\nSpeaker 2  36:16 Yeah, it's true. Okay, I think we're kind of getting to all we need at this point. Is there a possibility of like, we present with you to something? What is that meeting that you're in?\n\nUnknown Speaker  36:29 No, that's close to us, mate. You can't get\n\nSpeaker 1  36:33 into that meeting. I'll put your logo up. And also, there's a way, there's a way to present it. You need to know the room, right? To know the room, but I can, this will be just the first step along the way. And if you, if you want me to make a point, or, you know, listen, we've done it with Zora. We've been, you know, I need to know how long you've been doing it with Zora, since 2013, or 15 or 17 or whatever, we've done 55 implementations. We would give me the metrics. So this is who clariss is, right? And this is that. This is the, this is what they think of CPQ light. This is what they think of fast billing implementation. That's just one lens. It won't end there. It's just a conversation starter.\n\nSpeaker 2  37:15 Yeah, okay, all right, cool, yeah. We'll do that. We can do a sort of little bit of, like, who we are, sort of slide. Then we'll do the our perspective is on CPQ, and then we probably also do a slide on, like, our perspective on, for those kind of customers who might buy CPQ Lite. You should also do pre packaged billing. I don't we're going to get loads of detail on that, but we can just make those points. So you've got in the slides just, I think that's the challenge, just in terms of storytelling element is like, we're only about to do so much by Tuesday, which is why appreciate, there's not the room for it, that at some point we can help bring it to life alongside you. I think Jonathan, it doesn't have to be in that first room, but in a subsequent session, because a lot of this stuff is quite nuanced, right? So points on the side won't necessarily sell it. You want kind of Matt in there, as I understand this stuff. This is how it works. This is what it means that kind of conversation. But it's fine for Tuesday. We'll get something light touch, yeah, Tuesday, and we can work out how best we help continue to kind of push the story.\n\nUnknown Speaker  38:18 Well, the story is the\n\nSpeaker 1  38:20 master class that we're doing as well, right? Yeah, true. A lot of that's going to crystallise in that, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2  38:27 And maybe we make sure that off the back of that, we kind of play this is, this is how it went. This is where the story is what resonated.\n\nSpeaker 1  38:34 Yeah, totally, yeah, we can do all of that, that there's loads of loads of different pathways we can go down. But I'm all about building alliances across this story. And I see Clarence Claris is important part of this alliance, like, to get this done. Because how many times has Zora tried this? Like Zora verticals, you know, I mean the channel strategy. It's just no one ever gets it done. So I think it can be done. Cool, all right. Really appreciate the time. Let me know if you need the input and like, you know, keep it light touch, but just make the point. You know, even if you want to scribble something down in a, in a, in a doc, and then I can kind of synthesise out of that, whatever, whatever, gets the story across. That's, that's, you've all made the point. Back it up with something, right? I just want to back it up with not, I don't be sucking thumbs. I want to back it up with a, with a, these guys have got cred. They know what they're doing. They said this, right? You don't believe me, that's fine, but these guys have done it. Immediate media didn't need to be that way if we'd had a reference architecture, reference implementation, so they just make that kind of stuff, right? Good.\n\nUnknown Speaker  39:46 All right, that sounds good. Nice one, right? Shelton, all right. Thank you. Thanks. All cheers. You.

All right, so we're gonna get we'll just see move this meeting. Then, okay, let me move this meeting. Drop in 11 to 1115 and\n\nSpeaker 6  50:14 what we're going to focus on is just the start the acquisition accounts, what Todd Jonathan needs from us in slides, and then I will do it. Yeah, that's fine. That's what I need. Okay, I'll drop a message meeting now. Okay,\n\nUnknown Speaker  50:34 thanks, man. Do to this meeting.\n\nSpeaker 7  50:37\n\nThanks, man, dope problem.\n\nUnknown Speaker  50:42 Was it you? Was it you?

And you can take a customer, we have the capability to take a customer from 50 million to a billion, right? We can do that like someone just has to focus on it. But the bits of what I wanted to wanted to do, because this is CPQ light story is like, we, I'll tell you, we have a few things going on. We've got kind of cpqx, which, you know, we've got next gen CPQ which is like, what it's, what it says, like, bit of AI on it, fairy dust, improved capabilities, better analytics, all that kind of stuff. And then we got another thing which I can't talk about, which is happening. So there's a few flavours, but the most, the thing that I'm trying to get to in this call is this, if you think about vendor for life, take a met and just give me two minutes to give you the story. If you take a med tech company like 50 million, and we get, I think we get too hung up with B to B, plg and SLG, right? It's like they're arbitrary boundaries. So let's just talk about the customer. Customer comes in, they're small, they go through some kind of qualification journey, which is run by Zora acquisition. You know what? What? You know you from gov.uk, or you've not, are you? You know what's your, what's the size of the company, you interested in software or hardware, that kind of thing. So there's this kind of qualification engine, which or which Zephyr can handle. And you get to a point where customer goes, Okay, so what should you know? What's the right thing for me? And the qualification can be more complex than that, but it's all self service. And they get to a trial. Let's say they're buying software. Our hardware is obviously different. They're buying software and they get to a trial, they do something.\n\nSpeaker 2  1:56 Jonathan, do you mind if we put on AI companion",

So they, so they get to this journey, or they get to the end of this thing, and they, they, they, then they get into a trial, and they're okay, right? So it's all self service. Then at some point they go, actually, I kind of need this. I'm not sure if it's a service rep or a sales rep, but I need a little bit of something else, right? There's just something over at the edge. And maybe they do, maybe they and again, they self Configure. They get, they ask a question, do I need this or this? And they do a little bit of tweaking, and then they get to the thing that they want, right? So they're happy then, like, maybe, I don't know, six months or 12 months down the line, they go, Oh, I've got my first enterprise customer, right? Or, you know, I kind of, I need something a bit bigger. And they go, I don't need full blown CPQ, because we're not that complex, but I need something I can self configure, right? This is what I call CPQ light. It's like I've got some levers, some some I don't need all the compliance in there. I just need to configure a quote that I can then send to a customer. I don't want to do it in a spreadsheet. I just want to do it in something that helps me deliver, you know, really something quite quick. I don't have a lot of sales people, maybe even the CPO or the chief executive officer does it himself, and he sends out a quote that's CPQ light. Then he gets a few other sales people, and they using CPQ light. But then actually, they get to a number, 500 million of sales, and then they are like, well, actually, you know, and that's where the billing light thing comes in. And then they get to bigger, and then they need full blown CPQ or, or they've got 10 sales people, they need some compliance rules in there. And, and the story goes on right? And then they get big, and they need complex. Then they become a more complex business. So that's and the complex is where we start, and 50 million is where we don't start. But what I'm selling internally, and I'll shut up in a sec is we have CPQ catalogue experiences and acquisition, right? There's lots of services around those things, but the customer doesn't give a shit, right? They care about the story I just told, and the story is at the intersection of those capabilities, those products. That's how the customer sees us. Can I use an experience with CPQ that sits on top of catalogue that isn't that complex, you know? Can I use a set can I manage? Can I do a journey flow that has an experience at the end of it, and that's all they care about. So that's, that's what our customer that B to any, you know, it's B to B. Could be B to any, but B to B, what we call plg, self serve, all the way up to sales assisted. So the bit we're talking about today, and number one, you know, it's not, maybe an ill formed story, but that's, do you agree with that hypothesis? Kind of what we're doing the Clarice workshop on right, 50 mil to a billion. That's the story I want to build out. But secondly is the point positioning of what we call CPQ light. And I use that term loosely, right? So I'm going to pause there and ask and leave those two",

    "content": " questions with you.\n\nSpeaker 2  5:20 Yeah, because I guess, like, you already have Zora, CPQ, let's just forget that for a second. What I was thinking is, like you said, you can have, like a standalone thing, which is, I guess, some kind of life element of Zora, like you have to go into Zora or not TBD, but then you could work out a way of integrating that into Salesforce, or other sales application as well. But I think at the moment, you definitely don't necessarily need to worry about that, because you could just iframe it, to be honest, and then you need the API to send the data back to Salesforce like it doesn't have to be a, like, fully immersive experience in Salesforce, so, yeah, you could design it basically like it's a standalone thing that creates a quote. I think probably you need to think about some of the small customers who won't be so fussed about Salesforce. Might still want that quote to be signed, like, I agree to this quote. So there's some other functionality in there. I think it's not just add a bunch of products, tell me a price. You might need some like, add special terms, or like, a signature block type thing, and think about sending to E sign but yeah, I think that's good, because you'll get immediately, get a traction with customers. You don't really do CRM, like, instantly. So all of the plg firms are like, well, I should probably start doing sales instantly. Could just start using that.\n\nSpeaker 3  6:37 It makes a lot of sense to me as well, because a lot of the power, actually, of cpqx isn't necessarily the deep, complex functionality you can drive. It's the it's an integration there. And you can, for the enterprise. You don't begin to press customers, you can say, well, you don't need to build an integration into XOR if you use cpqx, because it's pre built for you. And I think that's what, again, the Big B to B, big B to C, enterprise levels will already probably have a very complex e commerce platform, which they're more than happy to integrate into a Zora. But it's the, like you said, it's 50 to kind of 200 million, which will often say to us, what can Zora do? We say, basically anything. And they say, but how in the front end? Oh, we need to build an E commerce platform. And that just ends the conversation. So I think the power of like a CPQ light that could be rendered into a front end, like web page or E commerce platform, user facing experiences that it offers that integration into Zora and in a light, lightweight model, so they can just get started really quickly and not have to build a really complex, complex orchestration to use or as the back end. And I think you're right in that the next step of that would be to almost have the billing lighter weight as well for that journey of growing the organisation. So you can start with a lighter weight billing, with a lighter weight CPQ on their front end, and then they can grow into more of the full billing, and then they can potential",

But it does seem like that 50 200 million is where customers will often go to the competitors who can't offer as much, but they can offer it easier.\n\nSpeaker 1  8:17 Yeah, I think that's a very good summary. And I The interesting thing about when you think about CPQ, light and or billing, is we think about the the the there are two parts to the platform, to this, to each of those products. One is the front end, one is the back end, right? So the back end does anything the front end, someone just chose to represent everything in that way, right? So it's like, you go into a candy store and all the sweets are all over the floor, instead of they're all in very discrete buckets, and you just go to the bucket that you want, right? And you and you build your bag in the way that you want to build it. And what I'm thinking is and what I want to get to is a definition of what CPQ Lite is, which I think Tom you touched on, and Matt, you were kind of alluding to there is that\n\nUnknown Speaker  9:14\n\nyou just count Jonathan,\n\nSpeaker 1  9:16 sorry, what I was saying is that what I wanted to get to was, did I did? I give the sweet store analogy,\n\nUnknown Speaker  9:23 you cut a definition, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  9:26 So the definition of what CPQ light is, right? So, like, I think we have to be precise. So I billing light, I think is another conversation. But let me just tell you how I think we get to CPQ light. First of all, if I go to the product leaders and what I'm selling internally is don't fuck with the product leaders, right? They know what they're doing. Insulate them, right? Don't do an immediate media on them, like insulin. Don't sell them. What's not there, right? Because we spent all of our time at the intersection, not at the products, right? So we spent a lot of time at the intersection. Don't sell an intersection that's not there, right? So insulate the product leaders, but let them go and build all the capabilities, right? That's what they're good at. They've got 30 years experience. They know what that that Manfred knows what he's doing. Errol knows what he's doing, right? So that's all fine. Those are our internal product leaders, but let's say you get, you get a sales team where you get Clarisse, and you go, well, actually, I don't need all of that right now for this customer, we have this experiences layer. And the experiences layer is both an external and an internal facing tool, right? So if I want to build a My Account page, you know when experience with the experiences thing would have made your lives a billion times easier with with immediate right? It is highly configurable. Yeah, anything you want to do you can do inside this new experience, completely different story. But my thing is, well, why don't we just take the things that you want in a CPQ light and abstract them away through the experiences layer, right? So it looks more sassy than enterprise. Do you know what I mean? It's like you just, why do you need to even touch the CPQ product? You just go, Listen, that's the CPQ product. Is just a front end that interacts with a bunch of API's. Yes, that's it. So, you know, ",

And I'll give you that\n\nSpeaker 2  11:38 as I wonder and I appreciate. It's kind of a bit complicated. But could you not just almost extract the how you add subscription or how you set up price plans and add subscriptions in Zorro, extract that, and then we basically made the UI a bit better. So I guess we can do the storyboard of like what a salesperson is likely to do, but in the same way, I want to add this amount of these products, this product's a usage product. I want to add a cap, like, what's the maximum we've got\n\nSpeaker 1  12:06 to match. We've got all of that. We've got the engine lives there, right? But what we've got in experiences is these components, right? And you can build a component to do anything, everything that you said, I can build a component for right? So I can put a team of people, and I can say, see that thing there. Give me that page that is CPQ light. And they go in, and they go, okay, CPQ team. I want to consume that. I want to consume that, and I want to consume that. And that's the sweetie shop, okay? And then you go, actually, what we want is a signature block, okay? Or we want this, or whatever that is, yeah? And we go, yeah, okay, we didn't build that. We'll go off and build that now, right? And that's like a two or three day job, because it all exists. The back end exists. You just need to put a wrapper on it. So I think what I want to try and sell again, as a further extension of this is, well, what does CPQ light look like? That's what. Hey, this is our partner, clarissis. That's what they said it looks like. Then I go to the product guy, and I say, all of that stuff exists, right? And he goes, Yeah, that will exist. So I go, Okay, now that, because what I'm saying is we have another product in our business that no one knows about, and it's called the intersection, right? Someone just has to focus on cerebral well, it, but that's it. But think about it. What does the customer buy? Is the intersection? That's the that's the customer journey, right? So the intersection is taking experiences and the CPQ back end and creating CPQ light for a vendor, for a partner like you. And then you go, yeah, we know. No problem. We can build CPQ live. We actually built, we could actually build it for you. It's got this stuff out of the box. You want another thing, no problem. We know how to do that.\n\nSpeaker 2  14:08 Yeah, nice, because this kind of would get us on to, like, what's in it for us. Ideally, it would be nice to have exclusivity, but doesn't have to quite get that far in, like, when customers want it, like we're the implementation partner, or we help it should be set up, right? And stuff like that. So, yeah, that would be good.\n\nSpeaker 1  14:30 I can get you a demo. I can get you a demo from the product owner, right, guy called Jimmy Coniston, and you'll, you'll immediately see where you live, because you'll go, well, CPQ light doesn't ha",

Then some wire frames, or we can try and work out what the ideal experience or journey would be with your product teams, or a little bit more canvassing of No,\n\nSpeaker 1  15:10 no, I. What I would love, this is a this is a big ask. What I would love is, if someone I've got to present this on Tuesday next week. Now, you don't need a full blown thing. Don't worry about it. But what I would love is I'm dropping in validation milestones. So I've spoken to everyone across Sora that everyone's buying this, right?\n\nUnknown Speaker  15:31\n\nThe product org, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  15:35 So what I would love is, I would love to say, and listen. So, so, you know, I pitched this up to clariss, who's a implementation, part of us in Europe. And and when I said, Well, you know what, CPQ Lite, they kind of came back with this really simple page and said, well, actually, here's like, five things. Like, we call that six things, or whatever it is, just one page and it looks like they want it to look okay? And I said, well, listen, we can make a decision, should it always look like Zora, or can it be because of experiences? It can always be whatever the customer wants, you know, but the idea of you build it and you drop it right into something else, that's the principle. But the story is, if experiences doesn't have, if the if the intersection isn't the product I CPQ and experiences, then you can't do that thing. But yeah, the end. So the I'm selling you the intersection between those two capabilities. So if you gave me a and I say, this is what they want. And I know that the capability is there in experiences, and I know the capability is there in CPQ. So you tell me why we can't have billing a CPQ light. Yes, that. So that's my ask, is if I could get one thing with five widget, whatever basic it can be, look, it can look shit. It doesn't matter. It, honestly, it just something, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2  17:06 full disclosure, we're obviously not UI designers.\n\nSpeaker 1  17:09 No, no, no. It's not. It's not. No, no. I don't want to UI. I want, I want squares on a on a screen, right? If you go, hey, I want this over here, and it's got these fields in it. You could even just put a, I don't know, PowerPoint slide together that's got a very rudimentary there'd be a block up here, there'd be something over here. So it's basically when Matt wakes up in the morning and thinks about CPQ, right? Most mornings, yeah, most mornings it's like in your mind, what is CPQ like to you? It just has to be nothing more than that, because what I want to do is connect the dots between, oh, we've got an experiences which is super flexible over here, and we've got a CPQ back end over here. So why can't I have CPQ light, right? Why do I have to? Why do I have to wait for next gen CPQ to land which has got everything in it, yeah, the 100 million dollar just going to sales assisted growth doesn't need that. Doesn't need all the bells and whistles. Just needs the thing that Matt wants them to have.\n\nUnknown Speaker  18:20 That makes, makes sense. Yeah, I\n\nUnknown Speaker  18:22 think that's good. I mean,\n\nSpeaker 2  18:25 obviously the sky's the limit, so we will have, we'll do some absolute we could, what we could do is absolutely core, and then just some ideas of additional things that we would need. And obviously we'll go Agile on it, right? And you can build some of that stuff over time, but it'll be good that you can see some future stuff as well as just the simple stuff now to make the coast.\n\nSpeaker 1  18:45 Because what I would do is I would say, Can I enable clariss as an implement implementation partner? Can I enable the sales team in their go to market? And if I can answer that yes, then that's, that's the story, right? With that. That's and that fee",

And then you do the same for billing light, and then you're, then you're telling this, then you've got, you know, Zephyr using experiences. That's the journey up to, you know? So it just makes perfect sense. But all of those are the intersections of the products, not the products themselves.\n\nUnknown Speaker  19:31\n\nYeah, because\n\nSpeaker 1  19:32 then you've got things like, like, Errol's building, who's running catalogue, soft and hard bundles, merchandising rules, you know, really powerful stuff inside the catalogue. CPQ lives on top of the catalogue. So you've got this kind of abstract you've got different layers of abstraction, but it's super powerful.\n\nSpeaker 3  19:54 Is there anything available on the experiences layer at the moment to read on, or is it still in its inception? It?\n\nSpeaker 1  20:04 Well, we have a front we built the front end. We've got all the kind of first principles in place. We're rolling it up inside Zora. I'd be more than happy next week or the week after, to show you a bare bones demo of this thing and what it's it, what you will like is you as an implementation partner can go in, build the experience, but interact directly with the API's in billing, anywhere in billing, and compose anything, right? Anything you want can be composed. So, yeah, I'll arrange that, Matt. I'll get a proper demo done for you.\n\nSpeaker 3  20:49 So it's almost a abstracted layer that sits it interacts directly with the API's, but it's not actually a user facing fit. It's in the\n\nSpeaker 1  21:00 middle, but no the c1 can build our customer can build with it. They can build My Account page. We're going to have a suite of out of the box components, you know, if you think about it, like fully formed things that you can just drop in, but they're also editable. You can build objects from scratch, components from scratch. You can build, you know, a single item that does a very single thing, like, give me the total value of your subscriptions over the last 12 months. So you can put conditional logic into these things. You can build dynamic logic into these things, you can continue. Can Build A container around them so you can drop them in anywhere, so they can live. You could have an, you know, assisted service, for example, I want an agent, and they're in Zendesk, but I want them to have permissions to see the user's account, but they can't see the credit card details. So you can basically do what you like.\n\nUnknown Speaker  22:04\n\nIt's incredibly powerful.\n\nSpeaker 3  22:06 And then the concepts of the CPQ light is that it would almost utilise this componentized functionality to be able to create\n\nSpeaker 1  22:14 that product. And what I think is the boundary is that the CPQ light would have a hard skin on it, which is aura, right? So that when you do go back into Zora, you're not like, whoa. What the fuck is that? Like? I don't know what that is, right? It's, so it's, it's, it's UI, like CSS would be one thing, but its capability would be infinitely extensible to the boundaries of or not infinitely, but extensible to the boundaries of what CPQ does today and in the future. But you don't But what's really interesting is the implementation partner you'd own, what that looks like. It's not like, oh, there's CPQ. Ignore all of that stuff over there. Don't look at all of that that's too much for you. And the customer just goes, sorry, I'm not buying that. You just go, that, see that little thing over there, that thing that's perfect for you. That's exactly what you need right now,\n\nSpeaker 3  23:13 the full features are what they need and what they use. There's no added confusion of Don't, don't, don't, don't click that button, because you click that button, it's going to cancel it at the wrong time. Then you're going to have to do reverse cancellation and all this stuff, because it is exactly built around, tailored around what their actual use case is correct. And what that\n\nSpeaker 1  23:32 means is, Matt, is that the the complexity of this is, are you breaking patterns? Right? If you don't show that thing, does that put you into this kind of Death Loop that you've like, you've broken the you've broken CPQ or something like, you've done something you can never get out of it. So I think it's, it's a careful use. You know, it's like, be careful with that power. But I think the principle is right. And I'd love to say, Listen, this is, I believe the product, org needs stories, and then, hey, we have, here's an intersection, CPQ experiences, that's it. And so it's really easy for everyone to understand what that means. So if you want to put down on paper or jump on a call or whatever you want, but this is a chance for you to shape that like narrative. And then you're then I come to you and say, listen, here's our kind of baseline components. You can go to a customer, when you're doing a bigger implementation, use CPQ as a sharp end to kind of get in and also the extensibility of CPQ, right? So you'll, you'll be able to say, well, you know what, what is the, what are the things I have access to, you know, CPQ, super Well, Matt, and you go, Well, okay, we can, but you don't need to be front end designers. You just build the component tree that's needed to deliver that CPQ light experience.\n\nSpeaker 2  25:06 That would be perfect. Yeah, that's yeah. All right, fine. So from your perspective, ideally. yes. What you mean in terms of enhancements that we would ask or make a Bill Well,\n\nSpeaker 1  25:21 no about billing lights. Why? You know, is there a? I mean, I guess the question is, is there us? Is there a? Is there a world where billing light was always tried this, right? They tried to do billing light, this code in Zora, which is billing light. But if you go to the billing team and say, billing light, you won't. There's nothing, no one's going to buy that. But again, what I'm thinking about is, can you abstract a billing light\n\nSpeaker 2  25:52 product to a customer I got you, yeah.\n\nUnknown Speaker  25:56 Is that? Is that even feasible? Do you think or not?\n\nSpeaker 2  26:01 Yeah, I guess it's just weird, because what will happen is it will be fine being light, and then they'll want something else. So what you're really doing is just masking the features of the full product. I suppose that you only enable features when they request, which you kind of already do in billing today with some things. So make it slightly more extensible.\n\nSpeaker 1  26:20 Tell me where the so.",

    "content": " So there's two problems with anything that Zora does. Number one, implementing billing takes too long, right? So for a $50 million dollar B to B, plg company,\n\nSpeaker 2  26:35 but, but it, yeah, but it doesn't, okay. It doesn't. If you're only configuring simple things, she has make a meal of it. But like, for some of our use cases, you can be doing the config in like three weeks. Matt, four weeks maybe.\n\nSpeaker 1  26:49 So let's pause there. That's what I want to spend some time tell me about that story, right?\n\nSpeaker 3  26:54 Yeah, to put into context, obviously this is not go live ready, but it took me and colleague, Ben Freeman, a day for SSG, and we're ready to demo a new subscription, new account, new payment bills accounted for, rev, rec. So for some businesses, it is very doable to set Zora up extremely quickly. Now there's all the bells and whistles that then around the business processes, like what email should go out when, and what events should happen when, and what other systems do we have to send data to. But the actual core journey of here is a new customer with a contact record, a payment method, and a subscription that's been invoiced, payment has been taken, recognised revenue, and the accounting is ready for the journals that can take a few weeks honestly to get ready if the business is in a position where they can accommodate more of the out of the box functionality, so we can definitely, kind of speak to that story and the types of guardrails that need to be in place for it to be that quick.\n\nSpeaker 1  28:03 Okay, well, so, so that is a an additional, very valuable thing, right? So we've got a team of people, data scientists, working on, how do you take complex businesses from nine month implementations to six week or two, three month implementations? Right? Reference, architecture, LLM driven setups, all of that kind of stuff.\n\nSpeaker 2  28:35 I don't think you need. Like, you're skipping the middle bit, though, of just delivering a project in a different way, which is probably just not using GS, for example. So yeah, you can do all of that. But like at the moment, right? You start getting a project, the customer doesn't really know what their requirements are. You start building some stuff. It's not quite right. You're doing testing, you rebuild stuff, and that whole process takes six months. Basically, that is what happens today, whereas, if you had a better thing, I guess, to your point of reference, architecture, just like we're going to build you either A, B or C, no variations, that's what we will build. Which one would you like? Then you negate all of that sort of back and forth and requirements and testing and stuff. So that's probably more than when you say billing light, it's the and Salesforce do this. It's like pre packaged conflict. So you buy automotive cloud or media cloud or something, and I'll be honest with you, it's a lie, though, that's all configured for you, but that's their sales pitch",

    "content": ", right, that it's all configured faster your business. It's going to work as active as you want it out the box, no problem. That's sort of thing that we could have done with doing or want to do originally with the media, right, where a client doesn't actually know what they need or what the next evolution looks like, just put something in front of them and then tinker and tailor from there, rather than starting grounds up because he's getting to a quagmire of detail they don't understand asking for stuff they don't need. It's a different approach that we wanted to try and make work and meet it, but then they got hung up on nth degree of detail and acceptance criteria and stuff, which compromised it. But the original plan was, we'll just build something that fundamentally works your business model and then tweak from there. So if you've got those kind of reference points of this kind of business, this kind of implementation, and then you kind of retrofit that's gonna be a hell of a lot quicker to something that works. And also, ultimately, look at what ended up having with the media right is you go shooting for the exact thing that they think they want at the start, and they never end up getting it anyway. So why not accelerate towards a thing which is 80% there, and that's your start point, rather than that being your end point? Yeah, because you should do like, LLM config sort of style stuff, like, that's pretty cool. That's a good place to get to. But I think you actually have a way easier route of doing the pre configured thing, and then you don't even need that.\n\nSpeaker 1  30:54 I agree with you. I think that's a very, very good point. So there's a difference between the concept of because CPQ light feels like it should be a configurable thing. It's contained. It's a container of ability capabilities, and you just want to use the capabilities you need, right? It's like pick and mix. But I think you make an extremely good point. Billing is a beast. Billing light feels like you could fall, you could fall over yourself many, many different ways, and never, ever have all of the widgets that you need but reference architecture in the 50 to 100 or 200 mil space, and obviously immediate is bigger than that, but reference architecture is the thing that we should be focused on.\n\nSpeaker 2  31:46 Okay? There's like known there's known key variables, right? So as you start hitting like US tax, that brings a whole load of complexity. The invoice is going to be the same. It's like assume 50 200 million you're selling predominantly into one or two geographies, or you're under certain thresholds. Therefore you don't need to entertain that layer of complexity. That's a really good binary question you can ask a client that either opens or shuts down a whole suite of what exists in billing or doesn't exist in billing. In some instances today we, I mean, Matt, you've probably got a pretty good handle on what the fundamentals are of this means simple. This means hard, and you could get, you could piece together. This is the simple there that should exist within billing, but doesn't today.\n\nSpeaker 1  32:28 I think that would be super helpful, because what's happened now is I run the acquisition, the order, and a guy called Ken Houseman runs, you know, no can order to cash, right? So we believe in the story. I pitched it to him. He believes in the vendor for life story, right? He calls it forever vendor, which sounds a bit like I should have a dragon, some kind of Starry Eyed dragon on the on the cover of that story, but he believes in that. And so what I would love to do is I'd love to go to him and say, Listen, I'm dealing with the CPQ light thing. But why don't we have these three reference implementations? Why, you know, is there something fundamental that we're missing here, because what you just said will makes perfect sense. You've got this, but if you want to open Pandora's box, then we can open it for you. But that's, here's the reference implementation. That's it. So I struggle to understand why that doesn't exist, like and you're a vendor, so if it, if you, if you haven't seen it, it probably doesn't exist, right? But it should now, if that enables and again, this is at the intersection, right? The the reference artist architecture is the inter",

I need some things that connect up with each other, that tell an implementation story, right? So ask me for that. I'll put that up on the screen. I'll speak to Ken before the presentation, and I'll say, you know, we talk about billing light. Billing light, actually, to a vendor like clarissis, means reference implementation, right? Reference Architecture. Here's, here's, here's less complex. Here's middle complex, here's super complex, however you want to represent that, or just make it, make it simple and complex, right? So you just got two things to do, and I'll go, Well, you know, as a as a vendor who's dealing at the intersection of all of our capabilities this map, Matt, who's this guy, says I could get this up in in three weeks or six weeks, or whatever, like not. I think you should get it they they can get it up. That's what they do, right? That unlocks this kind of customer. And then Will, Will says, you know, for the complex stuff, using immediate media, because everybody knows about immediate media. In me, if we'd have had this, it would have been a fundamentally different thing. Now I won't even mention GS, because I'm i I'm buying what you're selling. Tom, right. Difference, that's a different story.\n\nSpeaker 2  35:20 Yes, is purely there for some help if we need it, rather than implementation of any kind.\n\nSpeaker 1  35:26 I agree with you, right? I agree with you. So what I'd love is, this is what Matt says, This is what will says, you know, and what it means is two slides that everyone immediately crystallises the story, rather than me. I don't want to Pitch Anything. I want it. I'm actually bringing all the views up to the business. And you're one of those views, because the other is the differences in Europe. Sorry to interrupt you. Is the difference in Europe is we are, we are partner led like this, right? But in America, it's all i It's all is, is, right? So, so they're, they're totally wedded to B, to B complex SARS. They need a reason for me to force them downstream a little bit. But Europe's already there.\n\nSpeaker 2  36:16 Yeah, it's true. Okay, I think we're kind of getting to all we need at this point. Is there a possibility of like, we present with you to something? What is that meeting that you're in?\n\nUnknown Speaker  36:29 No, that's close to us, mate. You can't get\n\nSpeaker 1  36:33 into that meeting. I'll put your logo up. And also, there's a way, there's a way to present it. You need to know the room, right? To know the room, but I can, this will be just the first step along the way. And if you, if you want me to make a point, or, you know, listen, we've done it with Zora. We've been, you know, I need to know how long you've been doing it with Zora, since 2013, or 15 or 17 or whatever, we've done 55 implementations. We would give me the metrics. So this is who clariss is, right? And this is that. This is the, this is what they think of CPQ light. This is what they think of fast billing implementation. That's just one lens. It won't end there. It's just a conversation starter.\n\nSpeaker 2  37:15 Yeah, okay, all right, cool, yeah. We'll do that. We can do a sort of little bit of, like, who we are, sort of slide. Then we'll do the our perspective is on CPQ, and then we probably also do a slide on, like, our perspective on, for those kind of customers who might buy CPQ Lite. You should also do pre packaged billing. I don't we're going to get loads of detail on that, but we can just make those points. So you've got in the slides just, I think that's the challenge, just in terms of storytelling element is like, we're only about to do so much by Tuesday, which is why appreciate, there's not the room for it, that at some point we can help bring it to life alongside you. I think Jonathan, it doesn't have to be in that first room, but in a subsequent session, because a lot of this stuff is quite nuanced, right? So points on the side won't necessarily sell it. You want kind of Matt in there, as I understand this stuff. This is how it works. This is what it means that kind of conversation. But it's fine for Tuesday. We'll get something light touch, yeah, Tuesday, and we can work out how best we help continue to kind of push the story.\n\nUnknown Speaker  38:18 Well, the story is the\n\nSpeaker 1  38:20 master class that we're doing as well, right? Yeah, true. A lot of that's going to crystallise in that, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2  38:27 And maybe we make sure that off the back of that, we kind of play this is, this is how it went. This is where the story is what resonated.\n\nSpeaker 1  38:34 Yeah, totally, yeah, we can do all of that, that there's loads of loads of different pathways we can go down. But I'm all about building alliances across this story. And I see Clarence Claris is important part of this alliance, like, to get this done. Because how many times has Zora tried this? Like Zora verticals, you know, I mean the channel strategy. It's just no one ever gets it done. So I think it can be done. Cool, all right. Really appreciate the time. Let me know if you need the input and like, you know, keep it light touch, but just make the point. You know, even if you want to scribble something down in a, in a, in a doc, and then I can kind of synthesise out of that, whatever, whatever, gets the story across. That's, that's, you've all made the point. Back it up with something, right? I just want to back it up with not, I don't be sucking thumbs. I want to back it up with a, with a, these guys have got cred. They know what they're doing. They said this, right? You don't believe me, that's fine, but these guys have done it. Immediate media didn't need to be that way if we'd had a reference architecture, reference implementation, so they just make that kind of stuff, right? Good.\n\nUnknown Speaker  39:46 All right, that sounds good. Nice one, right? Shelton, all right. Thank you. Thanks. All cheers. You.

I can come over on Sunday night, evening, if you're, um, hi,\n\nSpeaker 1  4:49 listen, if you, if you're prepared to do that, I'd be superb.\n\nSpeaker 2  4:53 Yeah, why not? We can do that, because that way we can have a chart do a pen and paper. From pen and paper. It's not very hard to convert it into a visual. If we want to talk about the visual as well, and when you present it, you can probably say this is work in progress, but yeah, still, some concepts are are forming out in that.\n\nSpeaker 1  5:12 Yeah. So what I that? Well, that's exactly what I wanted to do. Is I wanted to go progress the story through because, actually, because Manfred and Errol at zag, I've got the full 45 minutes. So I wanted to progress the story through, talk about all of the stakeholders, talk about all of the different lenses, but that as I get through the story, tell a customer story. You know, what do we mean? Manfred made a very, very good point. Few good points actually, that come up. Man made a very, very good point. Plg and SLG is, is overused, right? Just follow the customer,\n\nUnknown Speaker  5:53\n\nright? Customer\n\nSpeaker 1  5:55 starts at here. They don't want this. They just need this. And then they get over to here, and they need a little bit more complexity. And then they get over to here, SLG. Plg is just labels that we give it to so that we can have some kind of sales motion, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  6:09 I agree with Matt, which is where we were actually going. I think so when we started talking like, extract the concepts out of it, extract the workflows out of it. When you build it, it's just the next flavour of that workflow, correct that SLG, permission control. So I agree with Manfred. He's right, yeah, it's we have to stay away from all those terminologies now, yes, plg, SLG, where it differs is plg has a pack motion because it's not the flow that is different. It's the go to market motion to plg from our site",

That's actually a very good point. There is a wrap that, yeah, when we call it self serve or sales assisted, or whatever it is, that's it. That's a, that's a that's another dimension. It's another way of looking at it. The I ran through a very interesting story with Errol to kind of bring it, you know, he has a man who tells a very good story about the customer journey. Errol and I were thinking about, you know, I asked him the question, you know, do we actually need Zephyr, right? Do we actually need this orchestration engine? And because I said to him, I said, let's just step back. You know, we know we don't want to be experienced cloud. We know we have to be very precise about where we start the journey, right? It's the Order, order presentation, or order orchestration, or whatever you want to call it, there's a very specific point at which we pick up the customer. And beyond that, we should not be playing. At that point, we should be playing. And I said, just give me. I said, Can you think of a story where Zephyr makes sense? And he actually said, Yeah, I can in plg, if I, if I land in a domain Omni, whatever channel it is, let's call it the website for now. And there's a series of kind of self qualification in order to get me to an offer to something to start me off. It might be, you know, did I come from.gov.uk or from something else? Right? So, what's the domain that I've originated from. Secondly might be, am I? No, I'm fine enough.\n\nUnknown Speaker  8:28 It might be enterprise size, right?\n\nUnknown Speaker  8:32 Talking, I'm just gonna get\n\nSpeaker 1  8:33 something, yeah, it might be enterprise size. The other thing might be, you know, you're looking for software or hardware, right? So, I mean, these are very simple examples, but you can kind of see someone, you know, you can see a c1 building a very simple flow to say, Okay, well, you know, this is and then calling in an experience, which is a checkbox form, and that passes offer into context. So you're building up some context of the customer, and then that, that calls catalogue, and it returns, you know.\n\nUnknown Speaker  9:05 So basically, you're saying that Zephyr is used\n\nUnknown Speaker  9:09\n\nas a journey builder.\n\nSpeaker 1  9:11 Yeah, it's kind of, yeah, it's, I think we need to give it, and we need to, it's almost like a qualification engine or something like that, because in B to see media, you know, it is the whole journey. It's everything, it's everything, you know, it's very, very complex. But in the plg side, it's just the branches are just a lot less complex, right? And I think the question is, is what you don't want is to create a gap in the last mile where that has to be handled by another system. It's just like, why would I do that? You know that so\n\nSpeaker 2  9:47 management would be where do we start from? Yeah,",

    "content": "me and Alan spoke about this as well at length. I'll share a document with you, which I have started authoring with Alan. There's a document, yeah, you will see that it's not structured by any means, but I'm going to share with you, because for now, what I'm trying to do with that document is, once it is structured, we'll come up with a view. So I'm already going towards this in zoom chat. I guess just the whole idea being, how are all journeys going to be structured? And I think we should not, we should not discuss, or we should not even think about, what's the first role in that? We should think about, what is my end state, yeah, and then we can see what Zephyr. Can I just tear apart Zephyr and use the parts? Can I employ Zephyr? We can come to that focus on the outcome. The outcome is what you said, even builds a flow or a journey. And then we map how Zora plays in that somewhere the context will play. Who's the journey builder? Who's journey orchestration engine, those kind of things we have to map out. Sure, I think we, at least at the top level, we should not get carried away what's going to happen with Zephyr. I know people want the answer for that, but we'll say strategy informs what happens to Zephyr. But for all intents and purposes, let's set a target that we will not use the word Zephyr ever again in Zora from after that point in time. You know the capabilities are consumed. Capabilities are Zephyr exists in bits and pieces, but that's it. It's Zora, whatever you want to call it, experiences, Journey builder. I'll leave you to the image. That's where I'm at least, at least. That's what I'm driving my discussions with Alan with that. Let's get to the merit of Zephyr. And every single time I discuss and double check something, I double click. Go deeper. Alan comes to the point. Now, this is very Zephyr specific. Okay, so is it worth? What is the amount of effort that you feel that I have to put in it to make it what I want it to be? Versus me saying, Let's rebuild. Yeah, I know rebuild is easy, but that is also need something that we need to suss out. Yeah, the goal is goal still, so that's that goal is what I think we've got to align on. But there's a\n\nSpeaker 1  12:12 very, very good example of the intersection, right? So if you think about the product, the product roadmap doesn't answer that question, because it has no concept of the other thing, right? So it that, and you would not expect the team to have that now you and I can evolve that, but the team, in order to do the job that they need to do, you need to insulate and this is true for manfred's team and for Errol's team, you need to insulate the core product roadmap because it's the thing that gets News Corp live, or it's the thing that keeps the New York Post ticking over manfred's Next Gen. You know is the thing that Boone wants right to enable his SaaS customers, but he also wants cpqx main, you know, stable. Errol needs to do bundling, hard, soft bundles, that kind of stuff, be",

So, but the bit you're talking about that, that level up, that's the abstraction of the intersection, for me, that's the bit where you kill Well, what is that thing? You know, there's a whole bunch of variables that a product team shouldn't be thinking about, because they are they don't understand the concepts over here, and then they don't understand that bit over here. Because how does that bit connect up to CPQ? Is there people\n\nUnknown Speaker  13:36\n\nlike me exist\n\nSpeaker 1  13:38 exactly? Exactly, right? That's the intersection.\n\nSpeaker 2  13:41 I have a controversial view, and you can tell me now you're wrong. I believe more the PMs lives, live, live in JIRA, less they think so. Their job, their their payback to the company, is going to be thinking. And more you think like, Hey, should I use an arrow? Does this many times? Should I use this rule engine or that rule engine? Forget about it. Doesn't matter. You were my partner. I'll come to you, but first tell me what you want, and then let me come back with the options. And then, of course, you have industry expertise. Then you tell me, I don't like this. I mean, you can be a technical person as well. But the first thing is the holistic thinking, the next gen CPQ. It's a bad story, because I wrote down every single thing for next gen CPQ. Wrote down the vision, the strategy, the execution plan, the DSLs, the technical architecture, all of that when I was in India, not this time, the last time, three months ago, we have had just, I don't know, turmoil around it, Satish coming in, team coming in, everybody coming in. And last night, I got a call from Shiva and said, Now you know, you wrote next in cpqs thing, we are going back to that like I'm used to that in Zora. In last three years, I've seen so many things I've said, and we circle back to that, I'm okay. My only request, again, I'm open for feedback. I'm open to change how and where I get can help. But I believe that whole thinking where we want to be is more important. And then we see, can I use Zephyr or not? Let's leave Zephyr out. Unification will happen. I'm not saying tactically. We're going to go away from that. That's why the document I shared with you, I shared that's what we are doing. But what is it that my customer is going to be like, Wow, they're not going to be caring. Did you use that for or not? That's in the material, in the in the in the timeline that we're talking about,\n\nSpeaker 1  15:31 the interest, but the, but that's exactly right. The intersection that I talk about is the story is that, if you think about the customer doesn't care, right? Yeah, they just want something that is covers the span of the use case that they need, where that begins and ends differs, right? It can start here and end there, or can. So I agree with that. But I think also one thing, there has to be a recognition of two things. Number one, it is it is not possible, I don't think, to find product teams that can live consistently outside of their own products, right? It's just too hard. It's just too hard. It's like it's you just got to think about one thing, right? There's very, ",

Second of all, we also have to acknowledge is, even if we have a strategy, the business will create conflict, because there will always be, if we just have this thing, we'll win a $500,000 deal, or we will a million dollar deal, or we win a $10 million deal, right? The thing about the strategy is that if the leadership understand what it's designed to do, which is long term versus very short term, when this, when the short term impact comes, you can just explain, yeah, we'll do that. But that's the impact on what you've just that thing you want to do now moves not just one product, but moves the whole strategy out, right? So that's fine. You pay the bills. If you tell us to do that, we'll do it, but we're moving it over here. And the other thing is, I guess, associated with that, is that if, if really the most important person in Zurich is Todd, because he's the financial engineer, right? And Silver Lake just want a financial engineer, then nothing that we do matters won't make any difference at all. Right? So those are the realities. But I'm absolutely convinced now that a part that you and I can do something, because I'll tell you something I've got people are very rare to get this, but everyone supports the thinking good. And I think\n\nSpeaker 2  17:58 maybe something for me to learn, because when at least I was pitching the same thinking I did not get the support. Maybe I was not in the product org. Maybe people saw, I do not know. Or, more importantly, I think there is something in the way you pitch. Maybe I have to keenly observe you. That's probably where I got a lot of resistance when I was pitching. I'm not saying anything different than what I said two\n\nSpeaker 1  18:21 years ago. Well, I think it, maybe it's the pitch, maybe it's just the organisation, maybe it's people. I don't know. There's a lot of nuance, but I think the most important thing is the thing that I I'll be honest with you without, without a good collaboration with you, it would not get done, right? Because someone described, someone also described you yesterday as an Errol whisperer, really? Yeah, who's that? I can't tell you, but what they said was that you, you have a very you have an ability to to connect with Errol in a way that it's hard for other people to connect, right? You're a deep thinker. He's a deep thinker. You're both technical. So you're also, I said this to you before, actually, I know I kind of this is reinforced. What I said is that you kind of bring muscle to this, to the story, because when someone goes, Wait a minute, yeah, but I know we covered that, and you know, that's been validated, and we've we've listened, you know, we've captured everything, but this is the direction of travel, and these are the principles behind that direction of travel.

I'm very visual when I present so I think one said that says, Listen, this is kind of the mental model of what we think. Errol knows. Manfred knows that this is not baked in stone. We haven't pitched this to anyone, but what, what's what, what should care and Pete have asked for is, what's the strategic what's the strategic approach? What do you How are you going to measure outcomes, right, and what are the risks, right? So, super broad. I don't think they're expecting this, but, you know, sort of ask for, so that's what I'm going to give them.\n\nSpeaker 2  22:03 I mean, either way, this discussion could be valuable, because obviously we can be Zora like, which is, just keep on executing a road map, and then you will fumble your way through. You will align some, you will not align others. You will deliver some, you will not deliver others. That's Zora. But if you can do it top down, if you can enforce and bring that rigour in this that, hey, this is a strategy, this is the architecture. This is what you're going to do.

For me as a salesperson, to come up to only chat interface is never going to happen. And there's a reason I say never going to happen, and never means next six months to one you're not going to happen because quotes in the market we play are inherently complicated. If I'm only dealing with products, prices plus minus, sure, not a big deal. I'm going to start dealing with, Hey, can you co term it? Can you drag the term? Can you increase by six days, five days? Whatever those things are. You do need point and click as well? It's going to be there until such and such time, but my personal feeling, and I'm not going in and then advising that, because I'm not knowing you're not involved in that now, is it doesn't need to be two projects.

It's understanding what that's doing, understanding what next gen CPQ is doing, and finding the intersection, because they will cut, they will overlap, right? And no one will have thought about the overlap. So we'll, we'll see. We'll see. But that's the flexibility. I said something the other day.

And then there is, you know, some core catalogue capabilities, like configurable bundles, etc. I believe a story needs to be built as to what is, what are the top 10 things that, if we did it, you know, as a product company that we build, that we believe our B to B, SAS players complex, SaaS will give us the gold medal, right?

We're almost like, you know, I'm using, you know, American football and analogy, right? The quarterback has six receivers that he is like, let loose, okay, yeah. And all of them are running like crazy, trying to find a route so that the ball can hit them, right? But the ball is only coming to one of them. Okay, so right now we are taking a shotgun approach. And I'm not saying that that we don't know what we're doing that not at all, but I still strongly believe that we as a unified leadership level. If you were to ask Ken, does he know what we are doing, for example, okay, if you ask me, Do I know what Ken is doing? Or rather, you know his counterpart, Aravind, or whoever, right? I know bits and pieces, but I don't know everything. Now that the goal of this P and T sessions is to bridge that gap, right? But I feel that the continuity is in some cases missing.

So we know that we are going to hit the mark. Because right now, you know, I don't believe right, we spend enough time product so in my opinion, this is where, you know, obviously, you know, I'll take feedback for my own team also, but I'm saying the product teams can play a significant role by collaborating so much, so much that that that, like you know, the left hand knows what the right hand is doing, right and then you form the chain immediately.\n\nSpeaker 2  3:14 So I, I agree with you. I don't think that's at the product team level, though, because that, in my view, that becomes the problem of dependencies and overlapping priorities. It's just a human process problem. I think the success of that will come in in Ken and I synthesising up this single, unified story, understanding the intersection between all of those stories and working to that, I think the capabilities that you talk about, and the big bets are the thing that Stephen Boone is talking about, which is, give me the things that help me solve problems for our complex B to B customers, right? So they're, to some degree, they are independently needed, right? There are dependencies, which we take care of in JIRAs, but they're, they're things that need, you know, CPQ needs to have better, I don't know, understanding of previous deals done or time to deal or, you know, there's an analytics component that needs to be there that's missing, whatever that is that makes CPQ better, or there's some basic fundamentals that CPQ next gen is missing that has to have, maybe next, You know, vibe quoting is the blue sky that, just as teen says in his notes, just shocks the market, just makes it go viral. Errol, needs to get bundling done, right? That's kind of hard, soft buttons. We've been promising that for a decade, apparently, and it just needs to get delivered. So that, to me, feels like the shopping list, and that you can probably draw straight lines between those things and the 12 big bets, because the 12 big bets are synthesised from what Silver Lake want. So I think that's what the insulation of the product roadmap is. So there's, there's a there's a function there between Ken and I to make sure, just at a functional level, that joins up.

Right? What the No am business wants is the problem solved for complex B to B. That is what. I'm sorry, that's right. That is what. That is what Silver Lake one, that is what the rest of the org, the kind of the strategic focus is, right? But we also know that in EMEA, there's a lot of B to B, plg and B to C as and there's a lot of B to any in in a pack, right? So there's some disjoint between the sales objectives, but, but the master objective is B to B complex sauce. Now, in my world, that is delivered through our existing product roadmap, right? We have, whether it's CPQ next gen or it becomes or there's a vibe quoting, think of that Doc. Super interesting, by the way, thanks for sharing. You know, hard bundles, soft bundles, merchandising rules, all of this kind of stuff. The core experience for my account, how it joins up to payments, all that kind of so that's the product roadmaps, which are driven by experienced product leaders need to be insulated in order to deliver that roadmap. Insulation, to me, means there have to be some ground rules around things like, you know, Toyota Financial Services coming and saying, Hey, we want this. And if you don't give us this, the deal is not going to get done. And with this 300k on the line, we're never going line, we're never going to get rid of that. But we have to insulate to some degree. But the direction of travel is, let the product leaders build unencumbered and in the best partnerships with the engineering team. So the the product that is, is in the JIRAs, right? That's, that's the corporate that's a core principle. But around the if you think about the org as a series of, you know, vent Well, it's a Venn diagram, basically, you know, experiences intersects with catalogue, and catalogue intersects with CPQ, and CPQ intersects with experiences, and experiences intersects with with orchestration and and so you can build this quite complex view of the organisation, which is a collection of the product roadmaps, but the intersections. And I think the big problem with Zora has been that no one has ever focused on the intersection right and the intersection is the story, and it is the platform story that that, you know, Pete has been talking about.

    "content": "he intersection currently lives in a couple of places. It's either things like interlock meetings, or it is dependencies. You know, one team creates a dependency on the other team, but it's abstracted away from the reason for the for the dependency, but it's just a dependency, dependency. Again, we're not going to completely get away from that, but that's typically how things have worked. So I think about the business as actually, the problem statement is in the intersection, and the intersection is how the customer sees us. You know, can I go from a self serve all the way through to us? What's that? Sorry, just one second. You want the iPad. Can we go from a self serve all the way through to sales assisted, right? And you can, you can tell a story to support that. You know, the customer take, the customer goes from $50 million B to B PL, I'm not sure I believe in plg and SLG, because it's really just what the customer wants to do at any given point in time. But, you know, they start off, they don't need much. They go through some kind of context, orchestration. They get to a, you know, a plan. They buy that plan. They trial it, then they buy it. Then maybe they need a little bit of service agent, or sell, or sales, you know, a rep, bit of light CPQ, but they don't need much. And then it gets a bit more complex, and so on and so so on. And you get all the way from, you know, in the kind of perfect world, the company goes from 50 million to a couple of billion, and they've gone through a life cycle with Zora, without having to start with stripe and then rip out stripe, and then, and then, and then put us in. So the intersection is that story. The intersection is how the customer sees us. And so what, what I've been talking to NAV about is, how do you architect the intersection, right? Not engineer it, but architect it. What are the patterns that we need to think about? What are the services that we have or would need to build? What is the lift that comes with all of that? And so I kind of, you know, just to be visual about it, think about it like in a burger bun at the top, you've got the story. The story has to capture, you know, elements of the the product roadmap, but it's primarily the intersection, and the intersection has to be the thing that the sales team or everywhere want to sell. You know, it's the slider from 50 million, up to a billion. I can sell anywhere along that spectrum. I can, I can upsell. I can cross sell. I can down, you know, I can, I can, you know, if the customer wants to go SLG, to have less sales team, he can also go plg, at the bottom is the architectural principles, you know, what is the pattern that we need to build in order to enable that story. And then in the middle is the product, right? The product is lettuce, tomato, burger, bun, mayonnaise, I don't care. You can pick and mix the product. And you know, at the moment, we've got those pieces all over the place. You know, the stories over there, the architecture is over here, the lettuce is over there. You know, you we've already got all of these things, but the intersection is, what brings that bun together. Interestingly, Steve Boone's view is, start at the middle, right? I need the middle bit give me the capabilities that help me sell complex deals. So that's where the insulated product roadmap is, but on the edges is the, as I said, the intersection and the story and the ability to sell anywhere along the spectrum. For example, vibe quoting feels like a really good thing to give to someone who's not ready to buy CPQ full, right? Maybe they just want something to play around with. Maybe it's just a self managed thing that they use. But beyond getting into that, well, rather than getting into the product, I'm going to pause there and just and obviously, there's a lot of stuff that needs to be filled in around that, but just get your initial view on that.\n\nSpeaker 2  7:44 Yeah, thank you. By the way, this is, you know, very, in my opinion, a very, you know, good way to describe the world with a lot of clarity. That's because when you're speaking, I'm like, you know, I'm sensing a lot of clarity, right, that we lack today, about about all these richness that we have. So the first thing that resonates with me is just that, right? And I think you're hitting on a couple of different key elements, which is, you know, how do we, you know, how do we power, you know, experiences, really. And I use the word experiences here, not in the in the experiences that we that we've been talking about using plasma, but I'm just talking about, you know, business experiences, right? The more powerful and elegant we can make the business experience customers would naturally fall in love with us. I've always had an eye for, you know, simplicity, right?

You know, once considered the cloud, you know, heart throb of subscription businesses, etc. You know, somehow we need to, you know, kind of like re image Zora with a brand new, you know, impression. And I believe that can only happen with the proof is in the pudding, with better than you know anyone else, business experiences, elegant business experiences, you know, so and I and that can only happen if we think with that as our leading perspective. Today, if you think about it, I'll give you a very simple example, trade web and Twilio are two examples. They both came in. We don't know when the discussions started, perhaps a year ago. You know, some people were involved, some people were not involved, et cetera. And we delivered, or rather, we signed up to deliver, you know, a set of capabilities or albeit it can be used by other customers. That's okay, but we never put what kind of business experience are we going to enable, you know, for these customers? And what happened was, yes, in some areas, we met their goals, but in other areas, like CPQ as an example, we completely missed their expectation, and now we're scrambling at the last minute to go cat play catch up, which you know what happens when you play catch up? You know we are rushing through design, we're rushing through decisions. We're rushing through UI because some commitment was made without thinking about a, you know, the top of the world business experience. So I think if we can focus, I think I everything that you said is, is really what would be needed to make that happen is even, even if a customer comes in, we have to sign a deal. We have to internally, you know, put a, you know, a great experiences hat on to say, How am I? You know, it's not, it's not that the billing team needs, you know, would be successful by delivering a silo of the functionality. It's how can Zora be successful? Right? Somehow, I believe the strategy needs to enable the, you know, the thing that I'm describing here,\n\nSpeaker 1  11:59 I agree. I think that. I think the reality is, though, because I agree in all of that, and I said the same thing to Manfred Nero, part of my job is to insulate and protect the roadmap. But it's naive to think that that will never be impacted. But a good story, a good strategic story, in the way that I think you kind of recognise is needed. If it becomes the sacrificial lamb, then everyone's grown up enough to know that's just the game, right? We're never going to get away from completely insulating everything. So, for example, if someone comes and says, Hey, you know we're going to, you have to stop everything, because we're going to do a $25 million deal with Twilio. That's still going to be the name of the game. I think, I think that will happen. I'd like to think that there's enough of a story about the future, but I doubt the reality is that it will actually change much, but a good story means and a good strategy means that you can use the impact of that change in direction to quantify the delivery of the story. So I'd be quite happy if they come and say, Hey, we've got to do this. We're going to do a 25 million deal with Twilio. Just step out of the way, because we're going to get this done. We're going to blow your road map up. And then you go, okay, that's fine. Just be aware that the whole platform story, whatever we're telling that's not going to get delivered for another six months. So I don't I kind of, I never mind that if the business makes a decision, it's revenue now versus revenue later, that's always going to be the Achilles heel of all companies. Maybe it's not for strike. Maybe they're so secure that they don't have to do that. I was speaking to someone the other day. We're talking about nui nui.io the and they were saying, the one thing they really do extremely well is turn down customers because they don't want their roadmap shaped by short term revenue. But you gotta be really, really confident to do that. So I agree with you 100% I think you have to also just call out the reality. But I don't think that changes the strategy. Because I think the thing that's missing in Zora, which you're kind of, I think validating is that, and I call it the intersection, which is the story, which is the platform, which is the cust",

And trying to move this into the product marketing teams, and have Amy De Lima join that story together, or Natalie joined that story together, that's the wrong place to join the story. The story has to be in our you know, the commerce org. And I think Ken buys this. But the other thing is, is that the customer of that story is also the product leaders, but they're also the stakeholders in that story. So there's a very kind of nuanced relationship that has to go on there that is, again, is all at the intersection and how you manage that. But in principle, I agree with you insulate, but I also think it's inevitable that someone's going to come along and blow that up at some point, but at least you'll know what the impact is.\n\nUnknown Speaker  15:21 Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I agree. I mean, I think,\n\nUnknown Speaker  15:26 I think they're hitting the right chords. So, yeah, so\n\nSpeaker 1  15:29 from an engineering point of view, so what I was, I guess this is really permission that I'm asking for, is I've spent a lot of time with NAV, right, and he knows where the bodies are buried. He's also a little bit of a an arrow whisperer, you know, they have a great relationship. So I, you know, he, he is definitely buying what I'm selling. He's also, you know, his job description is pretty much that that's what Pete's asked him to do. The other thing is, he said that he's always failed to do it with the product leaders. So he's quite I like nav because he's quite transparent. He's a strong view, but he's not unmovable, but he's also transparent. And he said, You know, I tried to do it and I failed. Because I just couldn't coordinate the product teams, which I can understand why. And so my bet was, in that burger analogy, that at the top is the story, and that then underneath is the architecture, and I need a kind of architectural ally, and then the customer of all of that. Because, again, I think about, I think about the internal org as a customer. I think in many ways, you're the customer of that story on the commerce side, right? Can I, when I come with the story, what am I? What does that mean for the architecture, so things like BCS, for example, or zems, or rules engine or whatever. And so what I'm kind of envisaging is I come to you and I say, Listen. So here's the story. I think I've got everyone lined up right the way through the organisation. And this is what nav is thinking. That story looks like architecturally. And then, then it's like, you go, No, that's, that's, doesn't make any sense. Or, why are we doing it? Like, you know, just the stuff that you and I like to do is just like, tussle it out and work out what all of the intricacies are. And, oh, we don't have the headcount for that. It's going to take you five years to do that. Or, why are you doing that when we could do this? Does that feel like the right approach? Or because, I guess I'm saying, do you come in earlier, or do I kind of shape nav into an opinion and then come and present it to you and get you to, you know, chainsaw through that and say, Okay, what are we talking about here? What's the best pattern for you and I,\n\nUnknown Speaker  18:03 yeah, that's a great question, because,\n\nSpeaker 2  18:09 you know, we certainly need so here's how I view this. So if you think about how, you know, you're going to be thinking across, you know, commerce as a, you know, as a strateg",

    "content": ", for example, right there are. So you've got, so let's just, you know, let's, let's kind of go deep, and then we'll come back up, right? So the current way of Operation seems to be, you've got a billing product manager that they all roll up to at the moment, looning, and then, you know looning Row is rolling up to Shakir. Looks like right. Sorry, Ken, Ken, right. So if you and Ken have a vision, let's say right, you are aligned. You know you're saying, okay, you know what I mean. The reason why I'm going down deeper is so there is this concept of a contract object. Okay, contract is something that we all know we need, because customers want it, and we know we want it, and the approach of how to achieve it is where I felt that there was a lot of like, you know, disconnect, if like, in today's world, nav did a lot of work, and then ultimately, you know, it becomes a problem, because, you know, some of the other leaders, like looning and others, were not right. Yeah, I would say that the idea should be somewhere in the vicinity of, you know, nav should be like abstracting concepts and say, okay, you know what? I am going to go down this path, for example, right? And the thing that he's saying he failed is there are many reasons. Is, previously, there was a lot of organisational, you know, misalignment, so therefore he couldn't do what he wanted to do, right? But if he has an ally like you and me, and then he needs an ally like you and me, influence move, you and can influence move, then we can, we can make sure right, we're all moving in the right direction.\n\nUnknown Speaker  20:45 Agreed? The thing that I would like to avoid is,\n\nSpeaker 2  20:51 is vetting out everything and then coming down and then saying, This is what we're doing, because that's where I believe it fails, and that's where the pattern I'm I've sensed that, man, you guys have spent a lot of time, you know, you guys, in the sense, when I say you guys, so now have an error, right? They probably spent a lot of time with what's called, you know, this merchandising stuff and, you know, call, you know, just name, everything that there's put in a lot of effort, right? So there's no doubt about effort and thinking, but what I felt perhaps needs to be done also is pressure testing with, you know, reality and bringing a delivery leader like me very quickly. Can, you know, add that perspective.\n\nSpeaker 1  21:38 That's exactly my point. And when you do that, and how, and what's the forum to do that? See, what we typically like to do is we like to create things like interlocks and these just, they're the worst me, I cancelled all the interlocks for my for my org, because I just, they're the worst things, because it just becomes a non meeting. There's no actions out of it. It's just, I don't know even I don't even know how to describe it, because there's a there's a nuance, isn't there? There's at what point is enough? You know, it's enough. Now let's go to the delivery partner and and we, we're coming here. We're not selling anything. We're pitching to a customer, right? He's our customer. It's like I said to Boon today, you're my customer, right? If you're not buying what I'm selling, I can build it all day long, but it's just you're not buying it. So that's it. So we have to listen like that. So we have a lot we have internal customers. The product team, are an internal customer. The other thing is, is knowing when to say, Listen, I hear it. You know, we're now making a decision, right? So this is like the presidency is, ultimately, there's one decision maker, and I'm not that decision maker ultimately be probably Shakir or Pete, but I think I feel like we've got, what I feel like we've got is this really good group of really smart people who have perspective. That's what I'm finding. I mean, Errol's opinionated, but he when you really challenge him, he has perspective. Manfred has perspective. Nav has perspective. You do, I do and I think that's the thing that that we can achieve. We I think we can do this now, whether Silver Lake gives a shit, I don't know. I mean, it could be that silver lakes, just listen, just get us to 3x we're doing Todd's the you know, could be that doesn't matter about vibe quoting, right? It could be that Todd's the main guy in this business. He's the financial engineer. Okay, who's the guy pulling, you know, how do we get 4% more net margin? How do we get eight, you know, 1.7% more revenue growth? Because that's the trajectory we need to sell this business. I suspect the thing they're not looking at is what's going to be the state of the market three years from now, and is 3x possibly five or 10x if you do the plot, if you do this platform thing, really well, right? Especially in this kind of data landscape, where, I think is, if you go further upstream with the customer, and you know, to the behavioural data in CPQ or packaging and pricing driven by seat usage, or whatever that is, that the data is actually the wrapper to the to the intersection, which is the top of the bun, which is the story, right? So it all connects together. So, yeah, okay, but I yeah, I think we have, I think that the story is, you're the customer to the story, and if you're buying it, are you going to buy it vanilla, or are you going to buy it with a, you know, bit of, bit of few other flavours in there, but if you're buying it, that's the win. And if there's a few other flavours, then we just have to knock that around and make it work, right? But at least, you know, it's battle tested.\n\nSpeaker 3  25:10 Yeah, yeah, cool. All right, are you? Are you?\n\nUnknown Speaker  25:18 You're at the you're not at Zach?

So my starting point is that the story is at the intersection of the road maps. It's not the capabilities that product leaders need to be left to deliver. You know, things like bundling, these are non negotiable things. But at the edges, you know, you raise the question of BCS, you've got focus on zems. There's what Manfred is doing, there's what Jimmy is doing on experiences. And there are intersections that have kind of an architectural dimension to them. They have a platform dimension to them. So there's all this stuff around it, but the principle that you described is kind of, I that's what I believe in but there's been a couple of instances where, and I think this is what I'm trying to extract from you. You take Adobe Experience builder, for example, you've said, Listen, we don't belong in that space, right? That that's we don't want to go that into that place. And, you know, there can be reasons for that. I agree. You don't want to be driving leads. You want to you want to be the point at which the lead has arrived, or the prospect has arrived, or whatever, or the visitor. And then there's something that happens. There's the implementation differences, which, you know, if we're a true platform, we should be able to deploy quickly, you should need to code anything up. All the intelligence lives in the in the platform, etc. So there's that. So you've cautioned me on that, and I listened to that, and then on the other side, what we've got is this B to B complex sauce thing from Silver Lake. Right? That's our battleground. But when I when I then look at what Shakir wants on his 12 big bets, and then when I go over to the EMEA team, or the APAC team, EMEA, for example,",

It's a it's from the least complex thing that you want to do, but we can still do that all the way up to the most complex and one of the one of the and again, this is slightly reductive, but one of the things I'm thinking of is, you know, if we put B to C to one side, because I don't think anyone's a big buyer of that at the executive level, B to B, they are. But the question is, can we be a business that goes from, takes you from 50 million to a billion, where you can go from self, you know, B to B, Pl G, up to B to B to B complex. SLG, I mean, if such a spectrum exists, but just at the two poles. And can you self serve and get the intelligence when you don't need to fiddle with the engine. You know, I don't need complex CPQ. I, in fact, I don't even need CPQ now, but I'm kind of thinking I might need it and I need something simpler. I don't need full blown CPQ. Maybe that's the vibe, quoting whatever it is. You know, I haven't really worked with it. I don't need a complex catalogue, but I do need an intelligence, intelligent catalogue.\n\nUnknown Speaker  5:45 I do have some AB testing I need to do,\n\nSpeaker 1  5:48 because we just, we kind of at that stage in the business, and then you go all the way up, which is, well, hey, I I'm buying something now, but I don't want to rip it out and have to replace it in three years time, because I do want to be a billion dollar business. So, you know, yeah, I could go with stripe, but then I know I'm gonna stripes not currently fit for complex B to B this, you know, we win more than stripe does in that space. So that's the kind of story. It's not dissimilar to what you're talking about. Because the you're saying, listen, everything has to a platform. Has to be a true platform. Things have to be connected. Journey that the intelligence is in the complete comprehension of everything, all the way from the first touch through to the retention, right?

And I understand the limitations. Now, I've also recounted the decisions against the catalogue that were limiting, right? That probably shouldn't have happened, right? But that's history. But so what I need you to do is, I need you to give me the boundaries. I need you to help me align with you as the first person in this story. Where are the boundaries? Can we be vendor for life? Can we be 50 mil to a billion? Or is that just a, you know, a nice way to think about it, not a practical way to think about it.\n\nSpeaker 2  7:31 So there are many ways to answer this question, and I'm not going to sit here and bloviate. I'm going to make it very simple between two ICPs as well as strategic control and fit for purpose apps. So number one, at the low we're not going to be a vendor. We vendor for life within our lane and within the areas that we dominate, is a viable pursuit, going after contested ground by thinking we can play there is where many, many vendors have historically wasted money and gone\n\nSpeaker 1  8:23 astray, agreed. What? So can you give me the contested ground because I want to get into because it feels like that's an I don't want to break your train of thought, but just give me contested ground for you. Is, where is that boundary? Right now?\n\nSpeaker 2  8:36 It's the boundary. Well, there are many boundaries, right? But number one, saying we're a CRM, number two, saying that we are a an acquisition solution, when we don't do any of the other martech stuff at this point. And like, going back to the CRM, like we don't do lead scoring, we don't do progression, we don't do task management, we don't do deal and pipeline and sequencing, so going in and saying, you're gonna have a deal room, and I'm gonna be just really, I'm gonna do Jonathan and Errol, not Shakira Errol, because with Shakir, I'm a lot more focused on just the message like Jonathan Errol is, like, There are some narratives that are clearly coming from people that don't understand enterprise software and haven't analysed what has happened in the market for 30 years. If you want to be a deal room, you have to understand, first of all, Walter Tango Foxtrot is a deal room. Walter tango, Foxtrot is vibe quoting like, look at what we are. We are a window into a complex SaaS offering that is surrounded by systems of record and execution. ",

    "content": "o to go back and just leave that general statement out there hanging right. Enterprises have, are lucky if they can get down to 500 apps. There has been a further consolidation. But at the at the low end, you're going into a SaaS vendor that has, like, G Suite, a lot of things, and like we have a core competency, the same as the enterprise, as long as there is a logical and team is also really good around this right, as long as there are strong and logical and strategic control points, and when we go into contested ground areas, we have a dominant play. It's a worthwhile investment, and so from my perspective, now, without being overly academic, let's say so be a large vendor. Same, same answer. Can we be a vendor for life? Can we be, you know, own that piece, building off the $332 billion Billing foundation, right? So, number one, we could be a vendor for life and billing and revenue management. That's kind of what we do. The question is, for us, with commerce and zepper and sub x and all these other pieces where we're parlaying into the experience, what is uniquely Zora, and what can we be the vendor for life? And the way I would attack that is the same statement we made the other day, and then back into the market, which is my non tech term, when a customer gets someone to the website, we can then, we don't do the acquisition, but we can contextually when, when we open The when they open the door to that subscription evaluation and ownership experience, we can embrace and welcome them with open arms, and we can manage the product, the offering, the configuration, the comparison, the management of that asset, Whether it is a SaaS software or whether it is media, etc. And I know media is a push, but let's run with it for a moment. And so when you now decompose it one step deeper, what does that mean beyond just like because I think we can go after CMS, but we are going to be the CMS vendor of life. But we, you know, everything we've talked about, the in commerce. But let's take it one step further. What else can we own? Well, I think we can, in addition to the financial accounting, I think we can own the orchestration of the offering delivery elements. So in simple terms, entitlement, order, orchestration for subscriptions and fulfilling on those pieces and all sales and discovery experiences, end to end, I gave you a very abstract answer. So simply put back office, vendor for life, yes, no problem. How far up office? Up or to the front office, because there's front that, there's experience and martech, there's front office, middle office, back office. These are uncontested truths. That is how the industry defines it, right? So I'm saying stay generally, stay out of bar like stay out of martech, but within experiences, in front office, I think that's contested ground that we can we can go after, and then within middle office, I think we could go after orchestration.\n\nSpeaker 1  14:00 So let me ask a question. If we were to say\n\nUnknown Speaker  14:06\n\nwe will not\n\nUnknown Speaker  14:09\n\nconsider Zephyr\n\nSpeaker 1  14:12 in a non media beta, non publishing use case, right? So it is, it remains an orphan. Is experiences, BCS, zems catalogue, that is the sharp end to the starting point of that that offer orchestration layer, right? So do we actually need a yes, no engine in The mix.\n\nSpeaker 2  14:57 I would it's, it's hard to answer because I think we have to look at now. We have to segment the industry. We as a company, do not acknowledge the success we've had in complex enterprise and the sophistication of many of the portfolio customer portfolios that we support so Trimble, Asana salon is zoom, buzz in simple, I'll say Zora, right? And that scenario, you simply can't achieve the task with a yes, no engine. But when, when we think about what this rules layer that doesn't exist should do. It should absolutely be sorry, orchestration layer should be able to utilise weighted decision logic constraints and rule an",

And I know agentic, if you look at ACP and all of those, I know they operate differently, but I'm just going to say it is my thesis, not proven that that is especially when you look at the evolution of some of these high performing workflow engines. I do believe we need something in that space, hard stop media. Yes, no is fine. But I also believe for media, our success is predicated Well, sorry, do you need the workflow? Not necessarily. You could catch every click and you could just run it into rules. But I think it's a better human experience if I could type a whole bunch of stuff, but I can see it map out as a set of sequential processes. Can you give me\n\nSpeaker 1  16:59 can you give me an idea of what a sequential process would look like in our and the ICP that would use that. So I'm trying to materialise what, what that actually looks like. Because, like, I think that the disjoint has been that when we talk about Zephyr, we talk about what it does today, right? But what we're kind of saying is, is Zephyr a fast start to this orchestration layer that then has utility in this longer story that we're telling? So I can how do I think about what Zephyr needs to do, Azure acquisition, or Azura orchestration, or whatever we call it. What does it need to do? Can you give me a simple example? You rattled off two or three things there. But when someone's dropping a node in and saying, I want the customer to go down this route, do you have an idea about how that would look or what that should be?\n\nSpeaker 2  17:57 Yeah, this is kind of like 25 year old technology like Do you remember the company named easy ask and all those guided selling platforms, right? So if you think about it that way, and I don't even know what easy ask is called anymore, but you get it like I want to. I'm just going to throw two, three problems out there. I am Trimble or GM or pactar, right? I want I have a fleet, right? And I want to retrofit my fleet to be a smart fleet with, let's just say, an IoT, a smart drive, cruise control driver monitoring, right? And on the one hand, you could immediate. So just park that use case for a second. The next one say, med tech. I run a I run 10 oncology offices or dermatology offices, and I need a med tech stack. These are all very common scenarios that our customers procure for, or even like BMC, I need, you know, systems optimization solution for fill in the blank. So in this context, I have a business problem. And number one, I'm not ready to configure, I don't even know that you want to configure. You might have a solution already. So what you want to do is the ability to assemble all of the context. It's like a next best action engine. That's why I keep comparing what is what are these martech engines? Do they do and the next best action for content and email, and then on the other end, you have easy ask, and I'm sorry this, and I'm saying we should be here, but there's a lot of the same technology. So going back to your point within Media, it is, I know you looked at three cooking articles or three business you played three games. Now would recommend the Wordle, or what package in our world that's a lot more sophisticated, right? Which is why I get into constraints and fuzzy logic, which is I need the best first of all, guide me to, and again, not yet configuration. Guide me to the suite of applic of the suite of subscriptions and solutions that best solves my business process for the three problems I talked about. And it isn't going to be I'm going to take you right to the end and say you need seven controllers and five seats and whatever. It's that journey. And so my hypotheses, when I talk to customers, right? The way they do it today is they basically take you to, you know, this is like, if you think about elg, like, they take you down to the instead of products, they take you to solutions, right and the solution page, then they get one level deeper, and then they're going to basically, from that point, they take you right into configuration. But if you think about it, my agent is buying on behalf of me, or let's not even get into ACP right now, it's just taking you through those consecutive layers of the journey, and for a complex solution, being able to basically guide the flow from offer present, ",

Are you like first person shooter where latency is important? Are you like robloxing where, like deep logic or something is important, I don't know you get the point. So even in an agent world, the agents the way, if you look at how agents are now being built and trained, the agent doesn't vomit it all out there. The agents go in and they actually do a sequential set of questions to another agent.\n\nSpeaker 1  23:01 I see, I see, I see, okay, so when you talk about the B to B, because, again, this may be just about translation. In when you talk about B to B, are you saying that the the flow, whatever that is has to using the whatever conditional logic or constraints or whatever is effectively creating a visual map where A a c1, is creating a a series of pathways for which it will guide the customer through.

I mean, I, you know, I understand AB tests and, you know, exclude this bit of content, and I can kind of get the configuration bit, but I'm lacking the clarity, because you probably know it, and I just don't on what the node would be. Is there a simple three node example? And you've kind of described it, but I just want to be very precise on my understanding,\n\nUnknown Speaker  24:31 yes, so could you so you give me a three node example.\n\nSpeaker 2  24:37 It's just preliminary qualification. So that way, so, so\n\nSpeaker 1  24:42 that preliminary qualification would be show a series of show this component that allows the customer to respond to certain things, right? Yeah?\n\nSpeaker 2  24:54 So, let's, let's, let's do med tech. Yeah, I like that because this is QHR. Is a great company. They're very small, but they'll walk you through these nuances, right? So like the first thing, and let's just pretend they're in the US. They're Canadian, but the first thing is, I sell software, and this is your world. So you log in and you either hit like Sam collaboration of a generic software, but you hit me from a hospital, or you hit me from.gov or edu, I'm immediately going to filter, and even though I don't know anything about you, yeah, I want to start with node one. Let's make it relevant.\n\nSpeaker 1  25:39 Yes, yes, got it. Okay, I understand that node\n\nSpeaker 2  25:44 node two, let's understand what problem you're here to solve today. Got it? Node three, let's begin the let's begin offer presentation. And node four would be configuration,\n\nUnknown Speaker  25:57 where configuration might be 100%\n\nSpeaker 1  26:01 you know, dynamic, or it might be dynamic with some hybrid, or it might be completely like a almost self serve, CPQ, in that you're not creating the quote, but you're basically configuring your thing in all and the pricing being interacts with the catalogue. The catalogue has all of these rules in it and and, you know, it has its own rules. Engine is returning the right thing based on that configuration, right? Yes, okay. Now, now I understand, now I understand that that that's been the missing piece for me. So I would imagine that there is a another series of branches, which is, if you, let's say that there was a free trial period involved in that, or some kind of paper trial that there would be, you could conceivably also include, because I think one of the things that's missed in Zor, and I want to share a deck with you, which been put together By the data my data science lead and with in collaboration with Anirudh, and it's entitled From fragmented billing and behaviour data to a single intelligence layer, right, which will probably give you a sense of where the direction is there based",

    "content": "on some real stuff that's been built as a POC, I would imagine that if you had experienced some kind of trial paid or otherwise, that the other branch might be to a decision, an AI decisioning engine that says, Listen, you know you're getting near the end of your trial. This is the optimal thing that we've built for you, right based on your usage. And actually, what we'd like to do is everyone that uses this thing, tends to also use this thing. So we're going to give you that for 30 days to trial as well. You didn't touch it. So it kind of has all it. And again, that's all being built from the catalogue. But it's, it's contextual, because it has the long it has the the true usage of the thing that was bought. But the other thing might be that a customer might go, Well actually, and again, coming back to this very simplistic AB test, let me run this AI engine versus, you know, a very manual thing, which is, hey, you're at the end of the trial. You now need to upgrade to these, one of these three packages, right? And we're going to, we're going to build these packages using the catalogue, and we're going to make a kind of, very kind of rudimentary, you know, ABC, but on the other side, we've got a, you know, something that's a bit more dynamic, and then we've got something that's very dynamic, and we're trying to work out which pathway we should be using and which gives us the better retention rates and upsell and all this kind of stuff. So is that, is that a B to B, plg, that sounds like a, that's a, be a, plg, motion, right? Or a B to any B to any motion that's not a B to B, SLG, because SLG that just doesn't touch that space. There's a lot of first principles that are similar there, right in the configurability and and I think in CPQ, my I've been challenging, not challenging, but asking Manfred a lot about context. You know, we're building this BCS and maybe some other services yet to be decided, or AI, or whatever, is context. Is usage relevant when you're selling, creating a quote, you know, I'm going to sell you 100 seats. I know that 65% of those were really well utilised. 30 of those weren't well utilised and etc, etc. So there's lots of intersections, there's there's these things. So is that a? Do you describe that as B to B? Plg, in your view?\n\nSpeaker 2  29:33 First of all, I'm going to say that's my dream. Second of all, I'm actually going to say it's B to B and B to C, B to any slash, any sales motion. And I know I'm literally disagreeing with what you just said on SLG, but it should guide you into that process, like the thing that I here's the thing that, what is the best sales rep do? They reduce friction, and without getting into it, I believe before you eat your sales rep even picks up the phone, it should be, Jonathan, you're coming. I'm your sales rep. Jonathan, like you're coming to me, and the minute I pull up CPQ, it should have the Jonathan dashboard of this is, why did that jump to the time machine that slide you and I built like, that's the vision. I've never forgotten that vision. I'm hoping we could figure out how to build it, right? So now Jonathan calls up, let's go back to bed. Tech, you're in oncology, because that's the example we always use, right? And we're like, Oh, I see you need a lot of imaging. I see you need a lot of collaboration, and you need a lot of deep data, synchronous, whatever. Like, Errol is a sales rep, but I sell software. I don't know anything about oncology. Like, that's where I'm saying this is B to any and any sales motion, like that engine. Call it the brain, whatever the heck you want to market it as you're a better marketer than me, but like that context, right for now, I'm calling it moves the multi, sorry, Master orchestration and optimization layer that should be turning and doing it all now, the beginning of your configuration process, your browse process, whatever it is, my upgrade, my renewal, it all starts with that. So the simple answer is, I agree with that vision. I don't know how to get there, but it sounds like you have some aces up your sleeve that you're thinking exploring.\n\nSpeaker 1  31:47 Well, I think what I'm what I'm doing, we can't, we can't be, we can't be irrational about the market that that Silver Lake wants to be in, right? So any story that we tell has to connect in some way up to that. What I know from the field, after many conversations, and maybe you have the same view, is that there is a sense that winning deals earlier locks in revenue later, right? So it's kind of a logical, you know, get the customer at the right ICP, when they don't need a full blown billing system, or they need some of the billing system, and there's lots of complexity. And you know, what's CPQ, light, what's vibe, quoting, what's billing light, all this kind of stuff. I haven't worked that out yet. I've had lots of different views, but I buy the vision that you articulating. Is the thing that when I came into the business seemed obvious, I've made some missteps in kind of thinking that there was, there was easier pathways to get to it. But you raised a really important point here. So we take Zeph up. And if you think about this, let's so let's say you've got CPQ, you've got, you've got, you know, Zeph is slightly anomalous, because I still have to run that but, but it's no",

    "content": " a complex thing. So you've got CPQ and, well, it's the whole commerce, but CPQ and catalogue, to be simplistic about it, right? You have this kind of, you know, you're going to deliver bundles. You're going to, you know, merchandising all that. That's kind of the 80 stack ranked items, right? So that there's, the first thing is, don't fuck with that, right? That That thing has to be protected. You have to deliver it. And that's the thing I'm talking about, a lot, CPQ, slightly different. Errol needs. Manfred needs to deliver CPQ. Satish is off five with team doing that, so there's a little bit of mess over there that I have to understand. Zephyr, though, has this roadmap for deeper integration into billing, right data, query approvals and workflows, making it kind of more enterprise grade. But the bit that was missing for me is what, and again, to be reductive, what is the node that you build, right? And I think I've just understood the note, what we're, what we, I think we can articulate this is there is a point I think you've, you know, we called it hand off. Or the point that, you know, the the CRM or the martech stack has delivered the customer to a point, right? There's a point in the journey where the up, the intelligence is in the off, is getting the customer to the right offer now that has a bunch of flavours to it right? It's, it's the nodes that you described. It's whether it's, it's the intelligence behind those, the configuration. It's whether it's entirely optimised or whether it's manually done. But it sounds to me that is Zephyr has any utility in this story. Its focus on the canvas must be, first of all, we're building a natural language layer over the canvas so that when you should be able to speak to this canvas in order to do the things that you want to do. So from a from a simple UX UI, it needs to be a first class experience right now, very kind of intuitive. But at the base, when you think about the DSL that gets generated when that, when a rule is, you know, built, it doesn't seem like a significant leap to me to start to bring these concepts into Zephyr and say, Listen, we have this canvas, the node needs to do this thing, right? It needs to, I think the example you gave is the POC, right. Can you? Can you build nodes that are capturing these decisions? And I wonder, Errol, and sorry, this is a bit rambling, but I wonder, I actually wonder, whether that's an easier thing to do, because, if you think about it in Zephyr right now, that we have to capture all of these very complex journeys through, you know, pathways and maintaining a B splits. I mean, it's not hard, but it's still comp, you know, still a bit more complex than what we talk about, but what you're talking about is I am, as the customer, going to respond to something that's presented to me in node one, or I know, first of all, first of all, we detect gov.uk, we do that. That's bread and butter for for or maybe you put in your email address, or maybe it's at the state level, anything, right? So that that's super easy to do. The next one is some table which is, which is the c1 might have put together from experiences, says, here's the, here's the, here's the check boxes that I want this customer to answer, right? Gives me some a bit more context. Maybe it's your title, or whatever, that is capturing that and then responding to that, because the capture is in the form which is super is super straightforward. The response to that is in in the catalogue, because that's context to what catalogue is then, or maybe that's stored in BCS right, as one set of attributes, you know, so that that attribute, that context, is built. Then it goes to the next node. And maybe, as you say in your medtech example, it's, I don't know, maybe it's hardware, software, whatever it is that's an additional piece of context customer gets then to the next node that then BCS is off digging around to write, to kind of find the right thing to present, or the right story to tell, or whatever, from the catalogue that those three nodes are not as complex and a series of nodes as Zephyr has to deal with currently. So is there something that I'm missing because it's very containerized, right? You know, it's action, response, call response, action, you know, response off, collect something back, or input something back. So there's a this conditional logic is not, I mean, I don't think, you know, Zephyr doesn't have the conditional logic, but to build that type of conditional logic is a very discrete roadmap item. So does the conditional logic explode? Do we need? Do we need very complex conditional logic? Do we start, you know, is it? Is that conditional logic? Does it need to be built by the customer? Are we? I'm trying to understand what the I don't think getting Zephyr. There is a problem. But I want to understand who is the engineering team, or what is the engineering talent needed to deliver that thing? Is there specialised knowledge that's needed? Would that come from your team? You know, where's that intersection of knowledge transfer, and what does that node actually how does it get built? If I go off the same, I don't know. Tie in. Say, listen, build me this conditional logic node. Is he going to go, I don't know how to build that, and I'll go, well, Errol, does. Or is it someone else in the business? Do we have those skills elsewhere? Sorry, that's an ill formed question, but it's kind of what I'm just trying to work it out.\n\nSpeaker 2  39:17 So bear with me one second. I just fired up my roughly, and it's\n\nUnknown Speaker  39:27 it's give me one moment please.\n\nSpeaker 2  39:41 So I know this is an abs",

    "content": "lute mess, right? But if you think about this, happens to be a merchant. Pretend this is not a merchandising flow, but this is downstream. What I envision is, let me, let me share what's here, and then let me back up. And then let's ask the question a little bit differently. Okay, so here you have inclusions. You have exclusions, by virtue of that, you have upsells. So first of all, these products are part of this bundle. So these are actually plans, if you will. Yeah. So the first thing is, I have layering. The second one is I have upsell, then I have inclusions and exclusions. And this is just very simple when I get into the bed tech example, if this stupid replica is going to work, of course, it's not, let me. Let me go back out here. So first of all, you should be able to generically and you see where I'm going with this. And for a moment, just bear with me, because we're having the same conversation, even though I went off at a different tangent, I should be able to put in my business objectives and parameters. I should be able to put in my business constraints and med tech, regulatory compliance. I should margin floors, etc. And then I write my rules, and it will look nothing like this. I like my other rule builder better, and forget about this graph. View what I actually envisioned, and hope we can achieve what nav envisions. And I'll jump out of this. What nav envisions is a graph. What I envision is more of a mind map. You could say, Why? Because a graph is very abstract and difficult. It's it's pretty and it's great for sales, but operationally, it's challenging. A mind map in my mind is, let's just do a two dimensional flow. You have all of the rules and constraints that that drive you to a node, which then takes you to your downstream options. Now the context and rules are where you start, and then when I jump to the next node, my entire world, just like in a graph, transforms itself. And now, because, let's just say, I went, I gave you an answer, or I looked at a product, now my upstream stuff changes, and it's all adapting. So I know you asked me question A and I answered question B, in my opinion, if we want to go to where the future is going, the vision you articulated 10 minutes ago or five minutes ago, like if we were to get there, I would say,\n\nUnknown Speaker  42:57 Sorry to be really candid.\n\nSpeaker 2  43:00 Let's not try to build on the effort or Zora workflow, or any of the existing metaphors, and try to escape to where the puck is going, is moving. And let's try to create a new visualisation layer for a graph neural network that can is also our rule presentation layer. I feel that if you then decompose that into very granular epics there, it's not that hard, right, like it is the big order of operations we've discussed. And yes, under the covers, other things happen. But visually, I have my my inclusions, my exclusions, my business constraints, etc. You can throw them. I've played around this with this and lucid actually, to better success than red lit. But you have kind of imagine you you have all those swim lanes, like you do in a swim lane diagram, like here are my upstream, my context, my constraints, you know, whatever other rules. And now you have your your view, and now you create your flow.\n\nSpeaker 1  44:12 And do you think the nodes? So when you talk about this dynamic nurse, if I, if I build, I wasn't entirely sure about the recomposition of whatever the the journey is, do you, how does the How does, what does the UI look like? It looks like what you showed me in, in replit, right? You've got this, you know, you can build the I. Like the idea of the swim lanes with these, with the with the, you know, each swim lane represents a thing you need to think about, right? So I think from a mental model that's really, really interesting in many ways, Zephyr has that in some way, because it's about anonymous, registered and customer. So the swim lane matters because you're doing it, you're in a different thought process when you're doing that thing. But when you talked about the graph or the or the or the flow, my feeling is that the all of the objects, all of the nodes, are present. Or are they in your mind, if you make, if you make a pathway, some of the nodes disappear. Is, is it meant to assist the customer and building. So basically, the conditional logic is in the Canvas as well as so your options to what you can bring in here might be driven by margin constraint or might be driven by HIPAA or whatever it is, right? So you only see the things that are relevant to the journey that you're building, or not. Is that? Is that how you thought about it?\n\nUnknown Speaker  45:42 Yeah. So a few things,\n\nSpeaker 2  45:45 everything needs to be, needs to originate from templates and business objectives. So, yes, a user can start with an empty template. So number one, during configuration, there's no way around it. You're just going to have to create basic governing rules, things like HIPAA availability. I can't go under whatever 20% margin your every business is different. Those rules are associated with now I know it doesn't exist yet. The JIRA is there. I haven't talked to you about it, but you know now we have this flat list, but assume for a moment that products become multi dimensional and they have metadata tags, families, etc. So a group of rules can exist for a product family, a group of rules can exist for a node within your catalogue, so a category, or even around a set of customers, so group of rules for healthcare. So once you park that and then you know that there are templates that enable you. Hey, I'm if I'm creating a marke",

So I want Midwest med tech providers. So I have, let's just say, in my known database, I have 10,000 and that jumps to like 300 or, let's say it's 1000 and then you say, Okay, now I want to go sob and slice and dice it. And then you're, oh, wait now there's seven. So if it's a marketing context, the rules dictate marketing. If it's an offer context, they just dictate how many people qualify for an offer, a product or whatever? But in my, my vision, or our vision, like, it should be dynamic. It should it should be an evolving canvas.\n\nSpeaker 1  47:51 It shouldn't be just this. Yeah, I completely get that so. But again, the engine to that is the catalogue, right?\n\nUnknown Speaker  47:58 The engine to that doesn't exist. No, no. But\n\nSpeaker 1  48:00 I mean the, if you think about it, the filter like so we have the filter at each stage in the build of that journey, about flow, the conditional logic is, must be saying, Listen, I the act, the attributes, or the features, are the thing that live in The catalogue. That's the that's the master database, right?\n\nUnknown Speaker  48:25\n\nI'm going, yes, and\n\nSpeaker 2  48:29 let's jump to the future. There's going to be context. There's within context. You and I can debate. I don't have the answer. I'm just saying fun debate, in my opinion, is how much use. So what is context? I'll say the other one is usage and stuff that's locked in billing that I personally think we need to pull out because billing is non performant. But fun debate for later. Yeah, context, usage, product promotion and business rules.\n\nSpeaker 1  49:00 Okay, so there is, there's a good portion in catalogue, but there's a there's some stuff elsewhere, right? So okay, we've got two more minutes. Let what is really fascinating about this is that the mental model that I want to give to the business, and I think I've said this before, is, and I opened with this is insulate the roadmap. Right? Insulate the roadmap for each team, they know what they're doing. Basically, don't fuck with it. Don't put unnecessary demands on it. Don't if you want to deliver something, insulate it. We need discipline elsewhere in the business. Toyota is a great example. We need discipline elsewhere in the business, right? Okay, that's number one. Number two is the at the edges are, the intersections are between all of these products, experiences, overlaps with catalogue. Catalogue overlaps a little bit. You know, it's a Venn diagram. It's a complex Venn diagram, right? So the platform story, or the sales motion that you've talked about, you know, where do, where can we play? And I think you've finally given me, I can visualise it now, is at the intersections, right? That's the, that is the, you know, you raise the question about, well, where should BCS live, right? Maybe that's what we that is an intersection. Maybe it's not. You talked about now usage and our journey flows. That's an intersection, right? So everyone has their own roadmaps, but there's an intersection. The hard part is, how do you operate the intersection? Because there's a few things, someone has to own the intersection. No one owns the intersection in this business, right? Second, secondly, the stakeholders, the customers of that intersection, are the product leaders, right? They are the stakeholders. They are the voice, but they are one voice along with the field, right? The go to market, there are the other voice is the customer, right? So my point is, is that owning the there is a third product motion. Well, there's two product motions. There's the product leaders, but the other bit is the intersection, and what I'm trying to work out with, you know, you've greatly helped me always, but more so in this conversation. And I think you've really helped me understand a little bit more about the possibility nav, I think shares, he kind of recounts a lot of the same language, because obviously you seem to be really well synchronised. And I'm kind of what I'm formulating in that my mind is, if is there a job to be done, to create a motion around the intersection that understands the stakeholders, of which the main stakeholder is the product leader, but to not call those intersections dependencies Right now, there may be dependencies in there. But typically where the problem occurs is that one product leader says to another product leader a thing, then that becomes a dependency in the roadmap. That dependency is not captured. It therefore has to get stack ranked, or forces something to go up or down. That then creates this ripple effect. And so I it's not fully baked, but I wanted to think about it, because maybe I want to just come back to you on Monday before I stand up and present it, because if you're not buying it, I'm not selling it, right? If I don't have buy in for the whole story from nav and you and the field and Manfred, I'm not Shakir, I'm I'm not asking, right? Pete, I'm not asking. I want to present this from the product, from the people I work with. So I don't need an answer now, but if you have any thoughts on that, you know, you've probably seen it tried and failed, but the intersection is where I want to focus, because I don't want to start talking about product leader roadmaps. They're they're good, they're solid, their bait. These are, you know, you've got more experience in in your roadmap than I will ever have. So touching that feels rather inconsistent with with, with what I think products should be, right? I don't want to, I want to understand ",

That, again, perhaps not so well formed, but that's what I'm thinking.\n\nSpeaker 2  53:29 It's very well formed. It is very so I'm going to say the deck has been stacked against us, because Shakir doesn't operate that way and and it has been my issue from day one, where he has siloed the org.\n\nSpeaker 1  53:51 Do you have to go? I've got a call. I've got a call, but I just finished your thought, Okay, so number one, you're very good at reading signals, like, like I am, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2  54:03 so vision is there, but now with you and Ken, you could bring this together. Number two, this is what context was always supposed to do. And like, lifting all like, we're a back office app. So in order to lift this all out, so we could do better analytics and this and that. So Shakir intentionally siloed it. I'm going to say something really mean, and I have told it to him too. He doesn't know how to run an enterprise stack. He needs to rationalise technology decisions. He needs to force teams together. And every time I ask him for it, it's he's like, I'm so busy. I'm like, because you have fucking 30 minute one on ones all day, I agree be an SVP, bring us together against the vision. He doesn't have the skill set. So just to go back, that is something we have to do in an evolutionary way. Number two, I agree with, like, there's nothing I wanted when I came to Zora, the whole context service vision was exactly what we articulated. There is nothing more in the world that I want to do that deliver that I just feel like we have to position it in a way this, this layer. It's one of, sorry, it's one of many layers that need to come together to achieve the vision. Yeah, so I agree with you that. Sorry, it's so abstract. This layer we just talked about is for engagement. You need another layer, for example, that came up, if you recall during the offsite, I don't know if you're there around like, structure, Domain Driven computation service they call the calculator. But number one, like getting everyone to align around these central pieces so it's not wedged in their roadmap. And number two, finding these other synergies. I didn't answer your question. I agree with it.\n\nSpeaker 1  55:59 You did. You did. So all right, I'm going to continue along the the hypothesis that I've got. Obviously, it's Thanksgiving coming up, but I'm going to try and snag you on Monday, because what I don't, I don't want to present something you haven't seen, right? So I'm going to try and polish it up. I think I have your narrative. I am going to say that, you know, this still needs to be battle tested. There's still a lot of conversation around it, but that's the direction of the story. All right. I super appreciate Cool. Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2  56:35 I'm happy to review, and I will send you my v5 deck, which is the new mega cover strategy deck as well.\n\nSpeaker 1  56:42 Okay, I'd love to read that. Cool. Thanks, Jonathan, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1  56:55 Sorry, man, sorry, no problem. I was chatting to Errol,\n\nUnknown Speaker  57:02 and we got deep into it.\n\nSpeaker 1  57:06 I wanted to, I wanted to get your, your input. I need some help from you. I thought that call, by the way, was really interesting yesterday. It says it's\n\nUnknown Speaker  57:20\n\nnothing, man, they're\n\nSpeaker 1  57:22 not but I learned what was really interesting. I learned a lot. I learned a lot about a little piece of the problem, which was quite cool, right? So that that was, that was really interesting.\n\nSpeaker 3  57:32 I felt, I mean, that definitely know how to talk, to talk, that's,\n\nUnknown Speaker  57:37\n\nyeah, they're good founders.\n\nSpeaker 1  57:40 This, this, I wanted to run, I've got to do this, this kind of 2025, minutes before you and Errol do your roadmap stuff. And I wanted to kind of just run a thought process through with you. So what I what I understand at the moment in your org is you are solving some kind of these big CPQ next gen problems, right? So, there's a, there's a shopping list of those things, you know, CPQ better than anybody. That's, you know, there's, there's cpqx, the CPQ next gen. And then off on the side here, there's this, which we, I think we touched on this vibe, quoting thing, right? And teen is running that really hard, right? I think Satish is in meetings two or three hours a day. There's definitely no one's listening to the compliance story, definitely. The story is it's a playground that gets validated later, right? But that's, there's too much momentum behind that. No one's gonna, no one's gonna change that momentum. It's either gonna work or not work, right? So, like\n\nSpeaker 3  58:48 the right. So it'd be we have basically these three streams, Yes, correct. So the existing CPQ exit needs to be served, and it has gaps and all of that. Then we have the next gen, which is also very similar AI, a lot of AI in there, and better UI and off of Salesforce, ideally, you know, performance is great and everything, yeah, and that we have by porting, which is not my problem,\n\nSpeaker 1  59:12 yeah, exactly, yeah. That's kind of what I thought, right? So this the story I wanted to tell, because I think there's, I think I can, I'm validated with, you know, kind of talking to NAV, talking to Errol, going out to Maria Janson on the analyst I'm talking to, feel trying to just capture everything is that my opening kind of thought process is, don't, don't fuck with the product leaders, right? They know what they're doing. The most",

    "content": "important thing is insulate those product roadmaps, right? So I've got a situation with experiences where, and you know, field has gone out, they've sold something that doesn't exist. All of a sudden, that roadmap is having to accommodate the thing that doesn't exist instead of doing the thing that should exist.\n\nSpeaker 3  59:59 Once I can, Jonathan, I'm like, What is your session about?\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:00:03 Well, when is it? When is it\n\nSpeaker 1  1:00:07 session is like, I think you got the, I think you got the you me and Errol are up at like, 1045 on Tuesday, or something like that. Okay?\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:00:15 Because on Monday, we have the Zach, right?\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:00:20 I'm not at this. I'm not\n\nSpeaker 3  1:00:22 at this. Yeah, I will be on Monday. Let me just make sure.\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:00:39 I want to make sure.\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:00:49\n\nZang, thanks,\n\nSpeaker 1  1:00:53 before you go. Yeah, I escaped that. Thank goodness.\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:00:57 No, no, no, it's okay.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:01:00 Think it's on the third I have it. I have a Zach presentation I still have to finish.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:01:05 Yep. So you, have you seen the Have you seen the agenda for\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:01:11 next week where you me and Errol are presenting?\n\nSpeaker 1  1:01:15 No, so that's why, okay, that's a bit odd. Nick hasn't sent that to you. Let me just pull this up so I may have it somewhere. Now in the email, it's just so on day one, which I think is the Wednesday. There is\n\nSpeaker 3  1:01:29 so on the third. I am a San Francisco on the second, okay, which is okay, that would be\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:01:41\n\nWednesday. And then,\n\nSpeaker 1  1:01:43 okay, that's, that's odd that they've double booked everyone.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:01:48 Okay, on the Thursday we end up from one to five.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:01:55 So are you? That's really odd. Why would they\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:01:58 always eat that? That's with,\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:02:03 so, day one, day day one.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:02:06 So once again, when is that? So, when is that? Session with you?\n\nSpeaker 1  1:02:12 Well, day one of the P and T leadership off site is the third and on the third at one to 145 was acquisition to order, right? So I wanted to bring you in, but if you're not there, it doesn't matter you were breaking up. I didn't get there. So what I said was, is that one to 145 on that first day, which is the Wednesday, which seems you're not there, was this acquisition to order strategy. It's not, actually, it's not a requirement for you to present. I just wanted to give you the opportunity to present, right? Because there's a brief we have to, but that's fine, right? So you're not there. There's no harm, no family.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:02:46 Aaron is also not there. He's with me. Then,\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:02:50 then it's gonna be me on stage.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:02:54 Didn't tell you that. He didn't tell me that. So that's fine. It doesn't matter. I can do 45 minutes. 25 minutes makes no difference to me, right?\n\nSpeaker 3  1:03:02 No, no. But I mean, like confused. If he doesn't say that, didn't he not realise that that we are maybe\n\nSpeaker 1  1:03:09 let me speak. I'll drop him a text, a slack to find out. But the bit so I was, I wanted to just be equitable about distributing the time. So if I have to do 45 minutes because you're not there, that's fine. I'm not there, that's fine. I'm not going to talk about your roadmap or Errol's roadmap, but what I do want to do is I want to tell you what I'm thinking so I can, you can say to me, Listen, you smoking crack. You're off on the wrong angle. You're going to get burnt, or this is the right kind of direction, you know? I just want to get I'm just listening right now. So the bit that. So my thing is, right? We ever the product leaders, have their road maps to and I've been on the receiving end of this. Let the product leaders build their road maps. You know? Great. There can be some feedback. There's some can be some shaping of direction based on the battlegrounds, all the usual stuff, right? But when it's when it's done, it's done it's done. The the job, the job, then, is insulated. Don't, don't get pushed off track. That thing has a direction. And the capabilities that are delivered to, you know, feed into a larger story. But the story is that the intersection between a lot of the services or the lot of the products in this business. So for example, catalogue and experiences intersect. They don't have the same road maps, but they intersect experiences and CPQ might intersect. CPQ and catalogue intersects, the context service, Zephyr, our data science, all of this stuff intersects. So the problem in Zora is there's no road map for the intersection. It's just called dependencies, right? Yeah. So it's a dependency, right? And then one product leader goes to another product leader, I got a dependency on you, and the other product leader goes, well, I can't give you that dependency, because I've got agents that, you know, I can't do it right, right? And the reason being is that the intersection is actually what the customer is looking for. If you think about the real platform play, they want it joined up. They don't care about the individual things they want that they want, the whole what's the outcome? What's my business process that you're going\n\nSpeaker 3  1:05:15 to give me? Right? Exactly. We are all about the intersection, like our value is that it works together. I mean, other than that, we would not have a justification. I mean, for CPQ, I will not sell otherwise CPQ, I mean, not otherwise sell a catalogue. Or maybe experience that I'm not so sure, but experience, y",

    "content": "u probably sell a lot. But my, my only existence is because we are integrated\n\nSpeaker 1  1:05:37 Correct, correct. So I've spoken to NAV and kind of pitched the same thinking, and Errol and I've spoken to a bunch of other people have been around in sort of longer than Errol and you and I have right, and the business has been taught. I mean, this is where Pete's platform thing comes from, but there's no coordination of the platform, right? The intersection doesn't really exist as a as a dedicated process, right? For example, a\n\nSpeaker 3  1:06:06 little bit of self organisation, right? Sorry, self organisation. It's a selfish\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:06:10\n\nExactly. Yeah, yeah, right.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:06:12 I mean that, Maria, I don't know if you've probably ever been in these meetings, but so there are certain product management, technical product management leads like Amy's people, they organise meetings where everyone comes together, and then it's like a free for all, kind of a thing which is very unorganised. No one is really well prepared. Everyone is bringing up a topic, and then for the next hour, we talk about, actually, not important, right? And the real thing is not going to get discussed Correct?\n\nSpeaker 1  1:06:41 Well, the first thing I cancelled when I joined Zephyr is the interlocks. There was these single interlocks. It was just 45 minutes of hell. So they just randomly talk\n\nSpeaker 3  1:06:51 useless shit. I know I mean, because no one, I mean, this is a problem here, but product management and how you visualise things and talk about things, and that's a different story, but they're now trying to improve. But you could argue that the improvements they're now making, because I talked to my TPM, and he basically said, are your capabilities right, and your big bets? And you you haven't done your capability? Sure, I didn't. But how does it work? And then it turned out that everyone puts their own capability in place, which is already a proliferation of things. So now you have one thing, like you said, the intersection, or that thing that you want to try to build. Let's, let's name it assist from from self serve to assist itself. Okay? I had config, probably configurable. Product is a perfect example where almost everything is touched, right? And I have that. And then arrow capable, and who knows. Then also building will put a plane, hopefully have to do some stuff, and maybe even you, who knows. So then we have five capabilities, everyone in his own little project. So we have five projects, five capabilities in there. Who can ever understand what's going on there? No one, right, exactly. And I told him. I said, Look, guys, at least make one initiative called configure a product and put all of our capabilities underneath that. So we are in our own projects, but at least you have now one area where it can go and say, let me see what is actually in there. Now that doesn't help. I don't know if it helps you from a reporting point of view. Can you report cross project? I'm not a JIRA, you know, Guru, but maybe it does help, but it's still a self organisation, right? It's not like there is one product manager who has the overall view, because our TPMS don't work that way. They just work also in their silo.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:08:48 Yeah, and there's lots of but the thing is, is also these people are generally they're experienced in the field of what they deliver, but they're not experienced in the organisational complexity to get those intersections working to create the platform. I can't speak for Ken's part of the business, right, but Ken shares so you know these views. I'm mainly interested in our commerce\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:09:14\n\ncapabilities, so\n\nSpeaker 3  1:09:16 don't get it. Why is this your problem to solve,\n\nSpeaker 1  1:09:21 because so I think of it like to be, be maybe simple about it. It's like a hamburger for me, right? The top piece of the button is the story. I need to know what the story is, right? And I'll tell you what I think the story is that I'm hearing right now from across the field. So there's the story. The story is the platform story, right? We want to deliver this thing, right? There's this. This is as a customer, this is what you're going to get Now, the story will be the story shapes a lot of the product itself. But I think the story that I'm hearing, and the way I'm feeling about it, is that in the space where we have the right to play, which is probably from the lead all the way through to the to the cash, right? So lead to cash, I call the acquisition the cash, but it's a bit bit fuzzy. Maybe it's lead to cash, or prospect to cash, or something like that.\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:10:16 Yeah, don't use lead. Yeah, fine,\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:10:20 but I don't have any\n\nSpeaker 1  1:10:22 numbers yet. It's not, it's, it's up the funnel a little bit because there's\n\nSpeaker 3  1:10:26 lead is all sales for CRM, yeah, I agree with you. You say lead,\n\nSpeaker 1  1:10:32 yeah, I agree with you. Is there's a thing that, when the customer lands and you want to do offer configuration, right? That, right?\n\nSpeaker 3  1:10:39 So that one self to assist itself. Perfect example, I would never call it a lead, right? So there's a code request coming in, right? They could place an order ideally, or they said, I need to talk to somebody that comes in as a quote request. That's not a code yet, but it's not a lead. I mean, you could in colloquial language, you would say, yeah, it's a lead. But because lead is so heavy with CRM and Salesforce is still doing lead management, it's like, its own area and complicated. Like, I agree. So that's why, like, I'm ",

It just, it just came in as a quote request, and that's it, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  1:11:24 Well, I thought acquisition to cash was right, but when I've done the research, when I've spoken to other people, acquisition is has also this fuzzy boundary to it, right? So we have to be very precise. I don't know what it is yet, but there's the way I'm kind of thinking about it is, and it has relevance to CPQ. So I'll get to that in a second. But underneath the baseline is engineering. I started the at the engineering right? Not not not at the engineers, but at the architecture level, right? So I really want to understand how nav sees the business. What you know when Pete says, platform? What does platform actually mean to Pete? Right from an architectural point of view, and then in the middle is like the product, or, I don't care if it's lettuce or bacon or cheese or whatever, that's up to the product leaders. Everyone has that. I always think of the total story. The one of the main stakeholders, not the delivery teams, but the stakeholders in the story are the product teams, but there are other stakeholders. There's the field, there's the marketing teams, there's the C level, all that kind of stuff. But what I'm thinking of is can, and I'm validating this, I'm agnostic right now, can set Zora from the point that you know, agree, not lead, not prospect, maybe offer orchestration, or whatever that is, be the vendor for life from 50 mil to a billion, right? And what that means is there's light rules, light touch billing implementation, you know, solid use of catalogue. You know, beat stripe in that territory, from 50 to 100 mil. Then the customer goes, Hey, you know what? I need a bit of CPQ. I've never done this before, but I don't need the really complex thing. I just need something, right? And then, and it's the same with billing. I need a little bit more over here. And then, you know, we've got, there's a, I mean, our AI, I think, is the capability that we can absolutely RAM home, because we own that. We've built this graph of of engagement all the way through to to retention, right? So that's completely a lot of data. We've got a lot of it, and we can bring more of that data in, because we know how to do it through the sub x acquisition. But what I was kind of thinking is that isn't the pitch. And I don't know, because Boone's kind of 5050, EMEA is like, bought into this apex, bought into it. But you know, can we be the Can we take you from 50 mil to our billion? Can we? Can we create that story? It is what you're doing on next gen CPQ, the intersection for plg to SLG. But also you mentioned it. I think SLG back to peer, or maybe someone else did. SLG firms are going back to plg. They don't want on certain things, on certain deals. They either want customer to configure the quote. They don't want a salesperson in the mix all this kind of stuff. And to me, that feels like where the intersections are, so that you're building next gen CPQ, right? And maybe vibe quoting lands, maybe it doesn't, but that feels like a very plg thing to me, like more AI, more intelligence, less need for a sales person.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:14:42 I mean, look, I'm like, maybe missed the train somewhere, but plg, what is actually? Plg, really, when you break it down,\n\nSpeaker 1  1:14:52 someone comes to, someone comes to, let's say, a med tech site, right? Buying some medical technology. Errol gives this example. I think it's quite useful. The journey is, they come from.gov.uk so, you know, they go down one pathway. We do some orchestration through the Zephyr engine, or whatever it's going to be. Then they say, you know, kind of business size, or whatever. That's another bit of context. And then at the end of that, there's, they want software, right? They choose software. So they've got to a point where we've got some context from them, and what they want to do is they want to trial software for a particular imaging machine or whatever, and they buy that, they buy a number of seats. They're on a 30 day trial. Maybe they have to pay some money. Maybe they don't, whatever that is, that's plg, right? So there's no quote in the process. And when you're small, when you're small, that's how these cut. These businesses go to market, right? They don't\n\nSpeaker 3  1:15:47 take it once again, size is another, another question, and we can then discuss what size these people are versus the other people. But from a from a delivery point of view, you don't care about size. You just want to make sure what you the story you deliver, and it's just a story you told me. I think that's the starting point for everyone. I mean that you need to start with, you know, tell them. Okay, here five different stories, and they all involve many of our products. And that's what I'm trying to solve, right? So, and some call it omni channel. Some call this plg. Some call it e commerce. It doesn't matter. The story matters. And story it here, Guy logs in from a small company or hospital. He's a he's a purchase or guy from a hospital logs in like name the user, very important. Who is that person, which organs he belongs to? He's trying to get some blah, blah, blah. And then you talk, talk them through, and this is how they do, no coding in place. However, there's an order that gets placed, and it ends up in billing and correct. Billing stock, correct. And there's delivery of software that we're not doing and never will do right? So, make the boundaries tell the story. Okay, that's Story number one. That's That'",

Now the same person comes in, buys, maybe another software, whatever has issues. Do not sure if he can do XYZ, what he needs, right? What he's not going to do, he's going to ask for assistance. Now, in your world now it's not PhD anymore. Now it's something that's bullshit. No one cares about that, right? What now happens a small piece of small variation that I don't know what I'm doing. Okay? Now you're asking and who get and who gets him help? Could be a sales rep, or it could be just a service rep, right? Maybe it's just a guy you know on the phone who knows a little bit about all this stuff, and just get them over the hump. Maybe they have the authority to give a little bit of discount, but they don't know anything about the product. So that could be a variation of things. Could be different users. Now they picked this up, but in our case, we would like the sales person to pick it up, right? So it's like, and now it becomes a coding process, and now you're technically in the B to B world, right? I mean, before, it was also B to B, but now at this point, they basically get clarification, okay, a software can do it. I think you're fine. I would like to have a three months trial for that. Can I have that? Oh, sure, you know, I can make that happen for you and, you know, and I call you back when it's time to or when the trial is over. Okay, good, done.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:18:46 Oh, make it more complicated. But now you have a contract in place, so you have already an established relationship. So third scenario like you get deeper and deeper into kind of complexity. Now, what is the contract saying? Well, it says I have to pay within 60 days. It says I have to I can buy that three products for that price. All other products are this price, so that maybe some prices are negotiated, others are not. I'm entitled to buy this. So there's all these different things that we as a company actually already doing very well, right? So payment terms, terms and conditions, all of that is already predefined. And now I'm executing as a procurement guy from the hospital, I'm coming in and said, I have to replenish something, right? So we had, you know, so I'm already referring to my contract. I'm placing an order on that right, not there is no need to go to a sales guy, but I'm gonna, you know, just buy something that I had a pre negotiation about it. Maybe I had that product for some hospitals, but not for all. So I'm not gonna expand it to the other hospitals, so that, why talking to a sales guy, right? I should be able to do that, right? I have already pre negotiated all this, this prices for these products, and that I can use them, and just a matter of for me to execute it. So next level up. Now you even further down, right? Maybe no contract is in place, but you want to have a contract. What I'm going to do now, I'm going to not even go on a website. I'm going to immediately go to the sales organisation say, Hey guys, we have a big deal if, like, we should spend 2 million a year on you guys, I need somebody show up here and help me figure out what we need. You know, new and you know, we are new hospital group, blah, blah, blah. We want to have this. Okay, good. Then, then you get into contract negotiations, and you start out with a quote, right? So what products are you looking for? What prices are you looking for? Now you basically start with a quote, then you have to negotiate terms and conditions, maybe, oh, what you 60? No, no, we only need 30 days and and the indemnification clause is not correct, and this is not correct. So now you're working on the contract. Now, after everything is said and done, okay, place, place, the board and the contract. So the contract becomes a real thing with commitments. You know, I'm promising that I'm using this much, and if not, I paid this much, so there's a lot of negotiations with it coming with it, right? So it's a bigger deal, right? And that is a, what is true, B to B relationship. Now you have that established. Now you have your frame contract. You have your first quote, getting it. So it's very low, like, very complicated, and from that point on, I don't know if it can get even more complicated, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  1:21:40 What's interesting about that, so is there, I've got a response to that, and that's super valuable. The I'm assuming at some point in there, I mean, you mentioned it in one context that transition from, you know, the guy on the simple trial, then needing a bit of service support. Is there a bit in the middle, which is the self serve, CPQ, so, you know, completely, you know, I move levers up and down, I kind of get what I want. You know, I'm not really into speaking to a rep. Can that be peppered in anywhere, that that could live a difference, right? Okay, so what I think is really interesting is that it's that by saying, Listen, there is no B to there is no plg and SLG, there's the customer, right? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:22:28 I mean, I first heard of the term and, like, okay, what are they now talking about? Never heard about, yeah, it's\n\nSpeaker 1  1:22:34 a way. It's a way of, it's a way of just delineating stuff, right, so that somebody understands it.\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:22:42\n\nWas e commerce.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:22:44 It was called E commerce. Everything you do on the website was an E commerce thing. And then in the B to B world, you then could transition to be, you know, now it's called assisted sales.

Oh, okay, I'm in, you know, impacted over there, and you are, you know, need to facilitate this whole experience and provide the right products, and then CPQ is in there, and the catalogue has its role. So now you basically on that story. You can see, where are these products hanging in, what function is needed in order to make this\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:23:32 the best experience in the world? That's the intersection. Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:23:36 That's the intersection. So in our company, this story is not owned by one person. It's owned by many person. That's why it's not\n\nSpeaker 1  1:23:44 working, correct, correct. There you go. Okay, that's my story, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:23:49 That's why I'm telling you. You paint these different scenarios. I like it. That's the vision. I like it. It's the vision of, what should this company even do in terms of commerce or P achieves.\n\nSpeaker 1  1:24:03 It's like Pete uses platform, right? I know what platform means, but I don't see platform thinking. But platform is the same thing that you're talking about. Platform is just a name for exactly the same thing.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:24:16 That doesn't mean it's all on the same like Salesforce is all on the same big beer month. No, that's not what a platform is. Platform means I get everything from one vendor, and they can give it to me in individual services, like I can call them individually and maybe stitch it into my existing, you know, world, or I buy everything from them, right? But you just\n\nSpeaker 1  1:24:39 described vendor for life there, right? You decide, yeah. I mean the first touch all the way through to the complex contract negotiation, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:24:47 So if you start over here, yeah, you can easily expand, you know, into the back. Whether you start over here, you can easily expand to the front. It's all, you know, integrated doesn't mean it has to run on the same software platform. It's just that's, that's a sweet in the old days, we said sweet, but sweet. Kind of people hate it. I don't know why, but they didn't like the name platform. Platform has more also the idea of, I'm making changes to it, yeah, agreed, agreed. Or I can use half of it, or one of it, and not all of it. And it's also fine, that's my platform has more the openness and configurability in it than a suite. Sounds like you're gonna use this? You got\n\nSpeaker 1  1:25:31 to take this, yeah? Because also the field likes platform, because there's a modularity to it. There's, you know, what do we lead with? What do we fast follow with? What are we up selling with all this kind of stuff? So do you think it, I mean, you've we've been here at the same amount of time. Do you think it is a pipe dream to sell that story? I can't think of another thing I want to do, right? Because it seems entirely logical.\n\nSpeaker 3  1:25:58 This is what ties everything team. I mean, what invest in Zephyr? I mean, the otherwise, the investment is little, right? The little pay wall thing that I think you guys,\n\nSpeaker 1  1:26:11 Zephyr has got to Zephyrs a sideshow. What I'm interested in is CPQ. I'm interested in the commerce thing, right?\n\nSpeaker 3  1:26:20 So here is, I mean, I talked to Shakir because my my background, I always come from companies that do all of it, right? So even very small with some of the startups I was working with. But the vision was a complete vision, right? The complete vision is, how do you get from the front, like you mentioned, lead, but I would just say, the experience, the self serve experience, all the way to the cash, yeah, as a company, we are so close, you know, because we have so many moving parts already, we never really put them together. I think that's my that's the biggest challenge of putting them together than having these\n\nSpeaker 1  1:26:57 parts so from a practical level, right? So if I kept stand up and say, Listen, enable the road maps, these things have the right direction of travel. There's no point messing with that. The story is in the intersection. Your narrative, I think, is extremely valuable, so I'm going to appropriate it. I will attribute it to you. But I think that narrative that you just, you know, told me, is exactly right. Errol gave a slightly different version of that. So fact, everyone's thinking around the same thing is important. There's another data story which I think I can tell. But one of the things that I am trying to do is also connect, yeah, yeah. I was,\n\nSpeaker 3  1:27:40 I talked to him about it because of agreement management, right? We kind of, we didn't have the first one that whole, like, without an agreement. But when it starts to become, you know, contracts and agreements, I talked to him about it. We found four stories that you\n\nSpeaker 1  1:27:55 can and use, okay, and nav, I think is bought into it. My question is practically right. The way I see this working is product leaders get on with the thing that they're doing. They you know that. You know. You know more. As I said at the beginning, you know more about CPQ, and I will ever know, although I'm learning, and I'm starting to see how it can, how it's where its value is right, and I can start to see why I think Silver Lake have put that, you know, it's one of the five things that's going to drive revenue, right? It's kind of obvious, but practically, the sales you guys are at the state, you're kind of almost the customer of this intersection story, right? Because it has t",

    "content": "Speaker 1  0:00 And back up, I lead our PE partnerships, and then workday co sell in North America. So really sales?\n\nSpeaker 2  0:10 Yeah. Do you want to tell me what a PE partnership looks like? What does that actually? What does that do? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1  0:17 So I'll share our PE field guide with you, which, which really is the kind of how I break it down, but let me just kind of give you, like a couple, a couple minutes on it so you can understand it, and then obviously stop me anytime. But I mean, actually, I probably should start with with this, right? So if you, if you look at our business, quite a lot of it, and there's some duplication here in the in the large ARR number that you see, so like some PE firms own, well, you know, there might be like Silver Lake and Tomo Bravo, own, own, one customer together, right? But we track across. Call it like 50 P firms, almost 3000 accounts that are that are owned by them, right? And a pretty substantial amount of ARR and then, you know, opportunities are owned by private equity firms that we have relationships with now. We don't have formal partnerships with all of these. Some are more important than others. I kind of break it down into kind of three tiers, tier one, tier two and tier three. But like, you know, I'll be speaking with VISTA later today on a quarterly check in on what's going on in the VISTA portfolio, right? And just to kind of play that example out for you here, right? If I go here and click Vista, see if this works. Okay? So you'll see, I track like, what are the customers that we own with VISTA? What are live opportunities that we have there? What are some of the kind of strong targets, such as, like a smart sheet, for example, that they've recently acquired that I think would be a very good fit for us. And we try to, well, I say we, it's really me, you know, meet with some of the stakeholders in the in the kind of the CFO office quote to cash base and and try to talk to them about what's going on our value prop. So, you know, we did a demo with VISTA the other month. I brought Chad Conley on to talk about collections and our AI strategy, which they appreciated and thought was very interesting. And, you know, I think, as it relates to the thread that got us connected here, there's a lot of fatigue in, in PE around, you know, legacy, Salesforce, CPQ, and there's apprehension to move to RCA and, and, You know, agentic billing, or whatever they're calling it, and and so my view is, there is, and I've heard this from like the Lloyds quote to cash PE leader to, you know, there's an opportunity for Zora to come to market with a CPQ and modern commerce message. I mean, everyone knows we're a, we're a strong billing and revenue solution. But I think, like in terms of injecting some new energy into this motion, if, if I could go to these PE firms and say, Hey, we've got some exciting updates for Zora CPQ, which actually, by the way, like a lot of like vertical, SaaS companies actually use it. I wouldn't say they're, they're necessarily happy about it, and it's kind of under, under known if that's if that's a term in the market that, like we that it's kind of even out there.\n\nUnknown Speaker  4:17\n\nBut my view is,\n\nSpeaker 1  4:21 I think we could do some damage in a good way for Zora and create, you know, pipeline and opportunities, if we could go in and say, hey, you know, Zora has got a great CPQ. It ties into our broader AI story, which is also something that they're interested to hear about. And like, you know, there's just a lot of firms that own a lot of customers or have a bunch of opportunities that, that we could, that we could take this to right? And so there's about, call it, a dozen firms that we really care about, upwards of 20 that we could, that we could talk to about this stuff. And yeah, so it's\n\nSpeaker 2  4:55 good as good lead. I mean, yeah, I can see the, I can see the, what the top of the funnel looks like it's kind of it in it's inverted. It's a bet it's whatever they call it, narrow at the top, wide in the middle, and then, and then slightly narrow at the bottom right. I get, yeah, I think it makes perfect sense. I think the the bit that I'm interested in is the story around this and how we present CPQ, so you talked about the wider commerce solution. The story that I've been telling is, obviously we have this acquisition to cash narrative, which was a useful way of kind of getting the business to think about acquisition to order right, because we typ",

    "content": "ically had not done that. We typically started at quote to cash or order to cash. But there's a whole world upstream, which is this, this dream of omni channel commerce, right? Which is something that Errol denga has been talking about for some time. We have an acquisition to cash story in media, but it's not big enough or important enough for the business to really pay attention to it. So the so this, the story that we're starting to formulate is around this true acquisition to cash, which is represented through omni channel commerce. And and the story begins, I think, with forget our segments. You know, whether we're interested in sub 100 or above 100 or because I think the ICP can sometimes be a distraction, but if we just talk about the types of companies that we could enable, and this is not a distant future. This is really about, how do we shape the existing roadmap to meet a market, right? So none of this is kind of, we're going to we're going to move the cheese and become something different. All of these components exist, but they've existed in a very fragmented way, and in in in many ways. There's a join between catalogue, experiences, rules, CPQ that doesn't exist. There's a kind of a brain in the middle. You know, we're building this out as this comes some kind of orchestration layer that's typically been duplicated across different road maps. But actually, I'm trying to extract out and create a single focus on, how do all these systems integrate? And the integration, or the intersection, is the thing that delivers omni channel. So again, back to my original point. The customer story is, if you are self serve, and I typically don't like to use plg and SLG, because I think they're a bit too rigorous, you know, kind of, they put something in your mind immediately about who you're speaking to. But if you're a self serve customer, then you should be able to, or if you want a self serve motion, you should be able to let your customers come in and interact with your product catalogue through some experience, without there being any service layer on your side, right? So just kind of, I'm a plg. I want to spin up some kind of plg experience, and I want to do that in a wholly self serve way. So I need a front end. I need a catalogue. I don't need any CPQ. I need, you know, we will put billing. You know, what does billing light or look like, so I won't touch the order to cash story. Then at some point, you get to a place where you might need some you decide you want to be a little bit more sophisticated on your go to market, and you decide to put some kind of configurable element to your product page. Maybe it's your enterprise cell allows someone to tweak some of the variables so you interact with the catalogue in a self managed way. But again, it's still not sales assisted. Then you get to a point where you say, actually, you know, I'm kind of ready to do this, but I need something bespoke now that could be agent assisted in today's new land kick landscape, or it could be a service rep, and that's where this, this this kind of context, hands over what you're doing as a customer into you're not at the deal room yet, right? You're in this kind of place where you're trying to configure and get to a point where maybe you do need a quote, but it's not the thing that's in front of you right now. And you don't actually need a full blown CPQ experience. You just need some, you know, there's a few things you need to kind of get right and then that's going to be good enough for you. Maybe you need a few, few extra seats, or some, you know, 100 extra seats. Or you need some new capacity. Or you want one thing that isn't included in the enterprise plan, or, you know, it's a usage based component that maybe you're above the threshold, something like so that's where you interact through a light touch CPQ. And then as you grow you, you know, we know that as you get to a certain revenue and you at your enterprise strategy builds out, you need more of a CPQ. And then you may actually get to a portion of your business that's entirely sells lead, right? So there's, there's both this, the the kind of point in time story, which is, well, we're not telling a growth story. We just want to be able to service anywhere on the sales motion. You know, anyone on the sales motion with all the stuff that we've currently got today, or we want to tell the story as a sales team that we're going to take you from 100 mil to a billion plus, right? So we're going to grow with you. We're going to we're going to help you evolve your strategy. You don't know CPQ is going to be what you need, but you are going to need CPQ at some point. And why do you need to rip and replace your system? You know, you might think you're starting light with stripe, but actually what's going to happen is when you get to three and I mean, assuming stripe stands still, which is not going to happen. But, you know, there's some assumptions here, and then there's sales led companies that want to become more agent led, right? So they want more self serve. They don't, you know that they were very sales led, but they want more of an agentic or a service level in the middle. So they go and back down, the other way. So the reason for that breed kind of narrative is, is, is that the narrative that you have in your mind, or is it only a portion of that which is a better CPQ, next generation of CPQ that has catalogue integration? So I don't want to over bake how I think about the P firms, but what's your reaction?\n\nSpeaker 1  11:18 I think it's, I think it's it's interesting. It's definitely not something that that we talk about. I mean, a lot of, a lot of my discussions with P firms are kind of with the CFO office, more like in the kind of downstream, rev, rec, hardcore billing, right? And so what you're talking about, I think could open up some discussions with more of like the go to market growth oriented operators and also, and kind of, then, you know, more of the kind of CIO technical type operators as well that are thinking about this strategy, and feel that, feel that pain point from from Salesforce. And then I think, to the extent that we could infuse some competitive perspectives on why Zora provides a more flexible approach along that spectrum, right? And, you know, they made a lot of like tuck in acquisitions are happening in private equity, which can present different companies with different ways that they sell, but like a flexible monetization layer that can adapt with companies as you kind of transform them, bring on more acquisitions and can enable you to sell in different ways. Is, a pretty, you know, sophisticated way to reflect our value. I think, you know, some of the narrative around, like the product catalogue and what that needs to look like with legacy sales force versus new sales force. Or if there's anything, any implications, there will be important as well. But yeah, I think, I think it's um, you know, we did get a decent amount of interest. I did some, like, thought leadership around, like, AI monetization last year. It was, it was well received. But ultimately, like, those people weren't, like, making buying decisions for for quote to revenue, or billing in revenue.\n\nUnknown Speaker  13:21 But I just, I just wonder,\n\nSpeaker 1  13:25 given the market fatigue and frustration with Salesforce, is there an opportunity for us to kind of go out and have more discussions with growth oriented operators around what Zora can can bring to the table here?\n\nSpeaker 2  13:42 But I guess that's the kind of feedback that I'm looking to explore, right? So I think the story receives a thumbs up from the wider field, because as a salesperson, what it enables you to do is to adapt your story depending on the customer that you're sitting in front of. So if you're a no, if you're in Noam, maybe you know and you're not interested in complex, anything other than complex B to B SARS. It does give you the scope to talk about this. Self sales led to self serve trajectory. But also, if you go and speak to Paulo or to mark gagne in EMEA and APAC, 60% of their business, certainly in Amir. I think it's even more in a pack, is B to, is B to any right, it so, so they have a lot of appetite for for and also the size of the companies are completely different as well. So you typically 10x a US company, when you're thinking about the sales op, what is the I'm writing our strategy at the moment? So I pitched this and kind of baked out some broad direction for Shakir and Pete. But what is the level of what is the document that you would need, do you want to read and know a version of a road map that paints this out in detail? Do you, do you typically like to consume a deck, or is it going to the PE firms? And, you know, I'm going to do this with Maria, with Maria Johansson, is go and speak to some friendly analysts w",

    "content": "ith a fully formed view of this and say, Listen, you know, this is we've checked, we've looked at your research, we've looked at where we are, we've looked at capabilities. We look at our roadmap, we look at the investments we've currently made, where we think we have a right to play. This is the story that we want to tell. Are you buying that story? Is it the same process with a PE firm, or do we have to be more exact and baked and fully fledged to have those conversations item.\n\nSpeaker 1  15:46 So firstly, I would be interested in reading it, just to kind of digest it and understand where we're going, and kind of try to put myself in the shoes of the PE firms. What what you need to know about PE firms, and this doesn't count for Silver Lake and GIC, obviously, because there are investors, and even though I do look at them as within this broader universe, right, and try to sell into their portfolios and get their help and support. But when we think about like the tomo Bravos and the VISTAs and the tpgs, like, it needs to be a baked out solution that's ready for prime time, for them to care, and for them to, you know, recommend it in their portfolio. That's why, like, there's this big hesitation to go to RCA, is because there's no references for RCA. Yeah, and so, like, you know, you've got system integrators pushing it, but until there's like, their private equity firms are very risk averse, right? I mean, they they're aggressive in terms of their timelines, and need to drive growth. And, you know, they fly close to the sun with margin and all that stuff. But for all those reasons, right? There needs to be like, certainty that the solutions are going to work in scale. And so, you know, we will, we will want to have a pretty close to baked solution before we begin to and then they're going to want to see demos, right? They're not going to be, I think, like, it has to be like a demo that we have, that we can show them that aligns with the story for them to kind of get bought into it, yeah, okay,\n\nUnknown Speaker  17:28 tell me a little bit about the the\n\nSpeaker 2  17:32 way they look at the competitive landscape, right? So sell, you've mentioned Salesforce. How do they typically view us. I mean, you said you sell out that typically the story is around the billing, the order or quote to cash story. Do you think that there is, you've mentioned the gap, but do you think that there is a right to play, or will it be jarring for you know, P firms that know as well to think about Zora moving into an omni channel now, because one of the real questions is, where do we not play? So where we don't play is Adobe Experience cloud. You know, we're not looking for leads. We really begin to execute what we do at the point the customer lands in any kind of journey that could end up in a seeing something from the catalogue, whether that's driven through a quote or whether that's driven through a self serve experience already, it's just very a basic rule that gets them to a front end that is Sitting on top of the catalogue based on some attributes and saying this, and this is what we think you need. So is there, is there, is there any resistance that I need to be aware of, or is, is it your view that we could play in this space? And P would if we had this fully baked out solution backed up by demos and maybe some live case studies that they would be receptive?\n\nSpeaker 1  19:02 Yeah, I think so. I think so, because of the gap of like so much of, especially in in the world of, you know, sales led B to B enterprise like so much of that over the last decade has has been shoved onto Salesforce, CPQ, some version of either zone billing or homegrown billing in the middle, NetSuite arm or revenue. And then, you know, NetSuite on the back end, broad strokes, generally speaking, like, if you're 100 million to $2 bi",

And unfortunately for us, more of that moved away from Zora than towards it during that time.\n\nUnknown Speaker  19:56 You know that the, I think,\n\nSpeaker 1  20:00 people recognise that we have a very strong, scaled solution, but, but they don't necessarily think of us on the front end. And I think, like, Salesforce sucked the air out of the room as that, like, go to quoting solution. And a lot of companies don't really realise that we have something to bear there, and especially now, because business models are becoming more flexible, right? It's, it's, it's, you know, artificial intelligence is very significant in private equity, you know, consumption models is, is people know that that's kind of where things are headed now. And and having just like a huge sales org that sells in a classic way, is, is being thought of differently, right, like the partner channel, I think is pretty significant in a lot of these PE deals. I mean, even look at Zor right, like we were, we were acquired by private equity, and we continue to double down on our our selling through partner channels, not that that necessarily affects like how we quote and sell deals, but for companies that are more like self service, you know, I think like selling through partner ecosystems, like that's a popular move in private equity too. And so to the extent that we can tell, like an omni channel story of how we can kind of unleash growth for businesses through self service, through partner channels, an alternative to being just stuck in what I call the CPQ conundrum, right? Like, not ready to, kind of in this bastardised customised version of steel brick, right? Like Zora can provide an alternative there. That's, that's the message I'm hoping to introduce to the market, if we can.\n\nUnknown Speaker  21:59 Okay, okay, which sounds like we're\n\nSpeaker 2  22:06 as a product team, we're moving in that direction the as I said at the beginning, the distance that we have to travel is to build a solution that has a holistic view of all of those capabilities, typically, certainly, my experience is, before I took this over, was that we have a we have a catalogue team, a",

So dependencies are just, typically, what do you have to give to me in order to for me to do, the thing I need to do. What we haven't actually looked at is things like, you know, do we have a single orchestration layer? Do we have a single context layer? Do we have a single rules engine that any customer can use? What did you know, regardless, you know, if I want to use a rules engine to do a basic conditional, you know, decision tree, or if I want to do something that's more complex in CPQ, if I then want to orchestrate front end experiences with some kind of conditional rule logic in the middle. What does that all look like? So I think that's the bit that we're that we've lacked, but\n\nUnknown Speaker  23:16 it definitely sounds like we have a\n\nSpeaker 2  23:19 right to play. From what you've told me in that space, it sounds I've had similar feedback from the analysts the field, the field. So I think the next thing for me to do is I'm going to probably complete it this week, is just to synthesise this into a road map strategy, give it to you and let you kind of run through it and give me feedback. The goal is that we want to demo this omni channel, sko at the beginning of February, and then use kind of two or three months in the field, polishing this up, getting our experiences layered to GA, getting a lot of the functionality that's next generation, CPQ to GA finishing bundling, you know, pre configured and configured bundles, and configurable bundles in the catalogue. And so I feel, my feeling is around, May, we're probably going to be in demo land, where we could do this end to end. But what I'd love to do is, while we're building that out, if you're, you know, if you're a consumer of thickish tomes of product, product positioning, although I'm sure you can run it through an LLM to get this, you know, to get the highlights, I'll send it to you and just see. I'd love to just get your honest opinion on it whe",

This capability can translate to nonlinear improvement in company growth, market share, and enterprise value. The path to successful global e-commerce implementation, however, is not as straightforward. It is fraught with complexities ranging from currency and language issues to compliance with diverse tax regulations. This research note outlines the major complexities associated with global and cross-border e-commerce and explores strategic e-commerce options that can help solve them. This note answers questions like:\n\nWhat are the opportunities and risks in\n\ntaking e-commerce global?\n\nTHE OPPORTUNITY:\n\nTHE REALITY & THE RISKS:\n\nWhat are the strategic and technological approaches to taking e-commerce global?\n\nCan the major e-commerce platforms (Am- azon, Shopify, et al) take your business global?\n\nWhat is the most effective way to globalize a sophisticated, multi-channel sales model (e.g., direct, online, and resellers)?\n\nGlobal Expansion remains one of the main avenues of growth\n\nE-commerce is the main channel for international expansion\n\nShare of cross-border commerce in e- commerce continues to rise from about 15% five years ago to over 22% in 2024\n\nSimple Vision: From a corner workshop to a global supplier with web as the channel for marketing and sales\n\nGlobal e-commerce remains complex\n\nLocalization: Languages, currencies, local pricing, local packaging \u2022Payments & Fraud Management \u2022Order Management: Logisitics, fulfillment, and returns \u2022Compliance: Taxation, privacy, local reporting \u2022Service: Customer service and engagement \u2022Expertise: Legal and regulatory, technical, marketing \u2022Complexity: B2B vs. B2C, physical vs. digital vs. hybrid, subscriptions and consumption, rapid business change, coexistence within a global omnichannel\n\nWhat are the financial, business, and\n\nbrand opportunities and challenges of us- ing a Merchant of Record",

Businesses that are aiming for international expansion of their e- commerce capability are well served to gain an understanding of a broad spectrum of challenges associated with global e-commerce. Even relatively simple businesses using established e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Shopify, are often quickly overwhelmed by the associated layers of complexity with rising product, pricing and channel complexity (see Fig. 1 above).\n\nBuilding a robust global e-commerc",

Local Content: The only practical way to really engage international audiences is to provide them with content that is locally relevant. That implies not just language translation, but content and products that are relevant in the local con- text. This means that the same product that may have been a run-away sales success in say North America, may have to be re-branded and re- packaged for markets in Asia or elsewhere and made available with pricing adjusted for the spe- cific geographic context.\n\n2.

When online consumers do not see pay- ment options that are locally familiar with, they typically abandon the transaction. Global E-commerce systems must be able to support local payment methods while ensuring secure transactions that comply with local regulatory frameworks.\n\n4. Local Tax Management and Compliance: Companies selling globally need to comply with diverse tax rules, regulatory standards, and reporting requirements, which can vary significantly from country to country. In this context, it may be helpful to partner with tax management software suppliers who tend to keep on top of local regulatory mandates.\n\n5. Local Fulfillment and Logistics: Logistics solutions can help organizations efficiently manage orders, shipping, and returns across the globe. Depending on the type of product (physical or digital or hybrid), handling products internationally may re- quire anything from minimal or no effort to a complex set of arrangements with local freight forwarders, logistics providers, warehouse vendors, importers and companies that handle unpacking, storing, re-packaging of goods for local distribution. All these steps translate into extra costs, time and risk.\n\n6. Local Engagement: A frequently overlooked element of building a global e-commerce capability is the ability to tailor cus- tomer service and communication to meet local language preferences and cultural expectations. Marketing collateral, cus- tomer communications, training materials, PR campaigns \u2013 all these elements need to be addressed in a local content.\n\nTo address the Six Local Challenges of Global E-Commerce, a business must be able to build a strategy for global e-commerce while balancing three key variables:\n\nWhat is the time- to-market?\n\n1. Time-to-market: How wide is the window of opportunity to enter the tar- get market with a given product and achieve critical mass in revenues and market share?\n\n2. Customer Experience: Is it imperative and possible to maintain a direct-\n\nto-consumer experience?\n\n3. Brand Control: Is it imperative and possible to maintain control over the brand experience locally, or is it acceptable to rely on a broad range of online distribution options and allow third parties to own the relationship with the local consumer?\n\nWhat is the intended customer experience?\n\nHow much control does the business want to retain over its brand?\n\nFig 3.

However, this could be a way to enable a rapid entry into a local market while containing the initial capital investment.\n\nMarketplace platforms like Miraki or SAP Hybris typically enable businesses to build highly brand specific e-commerce experiences and also create their own marketplace ecosystems, leveraging partnerships and resellers. This is a strong option for larger, more complex organizations aiming at several global markets, but it does require more planning and capital.\n\nBuilding a custom e-commerce site with headless options like Magento and Spryker provides the ultimate control over the customer experience and relationship, but requires deep expertise and higher cost. In this context, many organizations deploy a hybrid strategy that combines their own e-commerce engine and customer-facing portals with the use of a Merchant of Record capability to extend the global reach.\n\nHosted Store Infrastructure\n\nMerchant of Record\n\nA hosted store infrastructure like Shopify gives merchants more control over their branding and customer experience, but can be somewhat limited in terms of the trickier aspects of going global: regulatory compliance, currency conversion, language barriers, et al. They may have the basic technology, but not always the local know-how and on-the-ground presence. This option will appeal to organizations that have outgrown a basic Amazon store and are looking for more control over their brand experience.\n\nOutsourcing global distribution to a Merchant of Record (MoR) enables a merchant to retain full control over the customer relationship and experience while also delegating a lot of the local risk and compliance to the MoR provider. One way to think of MoR is that it is a virtualization mechanism for global commerce, where the local complexities are well-hidden from the main e- commerce engine.\n\nGoing Global with E-Commerce\n\nFebruary 21, 2024 \u00a9 2024 MGI Research LLC \u00b7 mgiresearch.com\n\nMOR 1.0 ",

    "content": "S. MOR 2.0\n\nThe concept and use case for MoR is frequently misunderstood. Historically, MoR (\u201cMoR 1.0\u201d) was served up as a monolithic, one-size-fits-all model. It was essentially a closed box that sat outside the client\u2019s main e-commerce infrastructure. It was coarsely granular, had limited visibility, and was complex to integrate.\n\nModern MoR systems (\u201cMoR 2.0\u201d) are evolving from one-size-fits-all to an \u00e0 la carte approach. This allows MoR to evolve into a modular, microservices-based Monetization-as-a-Service offering, addressing key elements of the modern quote-to-cash cycle and integrating into the overall Agile Monetization Platform (AMP).\n\nFor example, a company considering a global expansion may choose to utilize MoR components for order management, billing, global pay- ment, and compliance management, and integrate into the overall corporate monetization platform for other functions to attain more flexi- bility in pricing options.\n\nAn elastic global commerce solution built around a modern MoR enables features like payment method flexibility and local taxation compli- ance. Many modern MoR suppliers also take care of local representation issues by leveraging local entities as a de facto local merchant. The ability to select preferred payment methods (based on size and geographic location) and flexible credit terms and limits puts power back into the hands of the customer.\n\nConversely, an inadequate MoR partner can inhibit a company\u2019s ability to offer integrated order management. Global visibility over a single account is nearly impossible, as international orders must go through the MoR while domestic orders flow through the company\u2019s e-com- merce engine. Companies can combine a more modern, modular MoR approach with a headless e-commerce platform to create a unified transaction and order management engine, build local versions of the front end using a range of modern UI tools, and utilize MoR compo- nents to virtualize the global compliance and payment processing complexities.\n\nAn inadequate MoR partner can also limit the control a company has over its brand. Companies for whom branding is a value statement must be careful to select a flexible MoR partner. Some organizations get around this issue by coupling an MoR for international sales with a more standard e-commerce platform for domestic sales.\n\nFor traditional MoR 1.0 models, the financial breakpoint was historically around $100 million in sales volume. Some companies with higher sales volumes found value in the model due to its rapid entry into global markets and alignment with their interests. In contrast, MoR 2.0 models, with their modular and integrated approach, can accommodate larger sales volumes and offer greater flexibility.\n\nGoi",

However, geographic e-commerce expansion requires careful strategic planning \u2013 dealing with local currencies, languages, payment options, tax and regulatory rules, and logistics is expo- nentially more complex than selling in a single country. For most businesses, an ideal e-commerce solution would offer the flexibility to control domestic commerce engines, coupled with the ability to lean on an international commerce partner to meet global sales, currency, tax, and compliance standards with underlying infrastructure that increases options rather than limiting them.\n\nCompanies who outsource global distribution should reduce dependence on legacy, on-prem solutions (\u201cMoR 1.0\u201d) and look to the cloud for modern, modular options that support the needs of omnichannel commerce (\u201cMoR 2.0\u201d). Companies should think beyond technical considerations when implementing an e-commerce site. Look for a solution that can simplify legal entity strategies, compli- ance management, taxation, fulfillment, payments, fraud management, and localization. Finally, companies must be forward-thinking when selecting a global e-commerce strategy. The landscape of tools and strategy options in global e-commerce is evolving rapidly, so companies need to pick approaches that yield maximum agility and flexibility over the next 3-5 years.\n\nFor a \u201cbest of both worlds,\u201d ideal-fit solution, companies who want to grow their e-commerce engines should consider partnering with multiple solutions \u2013 one to handle domestic sales without compromising brand integrity, and an international MoR for global com- merce to provide breadth, flexibility, and the option to outsource foreign compliance challenges. This flexible, micro-services-based global commerce architecture positions businesses for their next stage of international growth.\n",

It\n\nintegrates with both Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Salesforce Sales Cloud for direct sales. Distributors and resellers are supported by Yagna iQ\u2019s own partner management functionality. The process for signing up and managing partners is robust, but the product\n\nlacks a UI for punch-out ordering. Users can collect payments and distribute funds to resellers. AI can parse email requests for quotation. Yagna iQ has web service APIs that can support a composable self-service UI implementation, although Yagna was not able\n\nto demonstrate a live customer website. Mobile users can run Yagna iQ in an iOS or Android app.\n\nThe sales catalog supports faceted search and product comparison. Every product search took around 4 seconds and adding four products to the cart took 20 seconds in the demo shown to Gartner. Users can copy a con\ufb01guration from a previous quote, and some\n\nsupport for product eligibility rules that control who can sell what is included. Yagna iQ supports selling simple subscriptions, with extensive support for renewals.\n\nYagna\u2019s product con\ufb01gurator has a good user experience and intuitive admin UI that supports reusable product attributes, aggregation/consumption rules, reusable subassemblies and a powerful condition/action rule engine. It also includes a productized\n\nintegration with the Cisco product con\ufb01gurator. Out of the box, the product supports multicurrency price lists, attribute-based pricing rules, basic volume discounting and\n\nconditional discounting rules. The productized integration with Open Exchange Rates loads currency conversion rates that can be used to calculate prices in a multinational deployment. Beyond that, clients must work with the vendor to add more pricing functionality.\n\nUsers can de\ufb01ne complex approval work\ufb02ows. Proposals can be generated from a\n\nMicrosoft Word template.

If the service is required to qualify for the bundle, the bundle can be split into the individual services outside\n\nof the context of a bundle. Existing individual services plus newly planned services can be grouped into a new bundle.\n\n\u25a0\n\nManaged service locations \u2014 Enable the administration, import and real-time integration of the set of possible locations for service delivery. A service location can be associated with a con\ufb01gurable service. The service location can de\ufb01ne the available options, features and service levels.\n\n\u25a0\n\nSubscription billing \u2014 Integrate the CPQ solution with the subscription billing solution from the same vendor to support both \ufb01xed recurring and usage billing.\n\nSell Tangible Goods\n\nComplex tangible products can be customized, visualized and sold. Shipping details can be captured and priced. Extra credit is given for generating CAD drawings for the proposal and as input to manufacturing.\n\nThe following criteria were evaluated for functional completeness, usability, ease of\n\nadministration and response times:\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00807121\n\nPage 35 of 51\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\n\u25a0\n\n2D visual configuration \u2014 The con\ufb01gurable product is displayed as a 2D image with all options selected. As selections are changed, the 2D image is automatically updated.\n\n\u25a0\n\n3D visual configuration \u2014 The con\ufb01gurable product is displayed as a 3D image with all options selected. As selections are changed, the 3D image is automatically updated. The user can change the viewing position and rotate the product to see it\n\nfrom any perspective.\n\n\u25a0\n\nBill of materials (BOM) generation \u2014 The con\ufb01gurator can generate the manufacturing BOM from the options selected.\n\n\u25a0\n\nRouting rules generation \u2014 A sequence of routing rules for the manufacture of each component of the BOM can be generated.\n\n\u25a0\n\nShipping charges \u2014 Shipping charges can be calculated either from internal shipping rate tables or via a call to an external shipping system. The shipping charge is a function of the weight, route and speed requested.\n\n\u25a0\n\nVisualizations in proposal \u2014 Both 2D and 3D renderings of con\ufb01gured products in the proposal or contract are included.\n\n\u25a0\n\nShipping details \u2014 Shipping details for tangible goods on the order are captured. Order lines can be sent to multiple locations by multiple shipping methods.\n\n\u25a0\n\nAbility to generate CAD drawings \u2014 CAD drawings of complex products for manufacturing can be generated.\n\nCon\ufb01guration\n\nThe product de\ufb01nes the options, features, rules and UI for a product with customizable options. Credit is given to features that enable a nontechnical business user to quickly set up and change products without IT support or duplication of effort.\n\nThe following criteria were evaluated for functional completeness, usability, ease of administration and response times:\n\n\u25a0\n\nFlexible, channel-specific user interface per product \u2014 The user interface for each product model is easily created without technical skills. Ideally, this is done using a WYSIWYG admin interface. Users should be able to de\ufb01ne a different interface for\n\nthe direct sales and self-service channels.\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00807121\n\nPage 36 of 51\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\n\u25a0\n\nActionable conflict messages \u2014 When the user selects an option that is not allowed, the system tells the user why that option is not available and suggests ways to \ufb01x the problem (for example, by deselecting a con\ufb02icting option).\n\n\u25a0\n\nActionable recommendation \u2014 The system proactively suggests additional options or changes. It enables the user to select a suggestion with a simple button click.\n\n\u25a0\n\nDelta pricing \u2014 All options are displayed along with the incremental cost of selecting that option. Where there are mutually exclusive options, selecting one option will change the incremental price of other options. The incremental price can be negative.\n\n\u25a0\n\nShopping cart for configuration \u2014 The current con\ufb01guration is displayed in a\n\nshopping cart that lists all of the selected items and their costs. That shopping cart can then be saved to the quote or order.\n\n\u25a0\n\nAttribute inheritance \u2014 Con\ufb01gurable options can have attributes (such as bandwidth, from location to location). The attributes of an option are inherited from a shared class (such as connections). Using classes reduces the maintenance overhead for groups of attributes that are shared across many products or options.\n\n\u25a0\n\nAttribute with domain based on a table or web service call \u2014 The domain of an attribute can be retrieved from a custom table or web service call. Users should be able to \ufb01lter the domain based on prior selections. This feature can greatly simplify\n\nthe management of large domains (for example, the cities where a service is provided).\n\n\u25a0\n\nCondition/action rules \u2014 The con\ufb01gurator supports rules of the form: IF [Boolean condition] THEN [perform action].\n\n\u25a0\n\nConstraint-solving rules \u2014 The con\ufb01gurator supports rules of the form: ENSURE [Boolean condition]. These rules require a more sophisticated rule engine that automatically selects and deselects options to enforce the rule. These rules can be slightly harder to understand than condition/action rules, but they are often more\n\npowerful and succinct.\n\n\u25a0\n\nAggregation/consumption rules \u2014 The con\ufb01gurator supports rules of the form:\n\nENSURE [Aggregated quantity < Available quantity]. This powerful technique ensures that \ufb01nite resources are not overconsumed.\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00807121\n\nPage 37 of 51\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\n\u25a0\n\nReusable subassemblies \u2014 A con\ufb01gurable model can include other con\ufb01gurable models as subcomponents. Users should be able to write rules in the parent model\n\nthat impact options and attributes of the child models. This feature avoids a lot of duplicate maintenance where a subassembly is used by multiple parent assemblies.\n\n\u25a0\n\nIterations of child subassemblies \u2014 A parent con\ufb01gurable model can support one to N instances of the same child subassembly. Each instance is individually con\ufb01gured. This feature enables the con\ufb01guration of products, such as rack servers, whose racks are each individually con\ufb01gurable.\n\n\u25a0\n\nRules that query the transactional context \u2014 Con\ufb01guration rules can reference attributes of the transactional context (for example, customer type, geography and customer assets).\n\n\u25a0\n\nNetwork configuration \u2014 An unlimited set of node con\ufb01guration models can be\n\nlinked into a complex network or system (e.g., manufacturing line). Users should be able to write rules that constrain attributes across linked node models and aggregated attribute values across the whole system. An intuitive UI for constructing the system/network should be provided.\n\n\u25a0\n\nDate effectiveness \u2014 Each con\ufb01guration rule and component can have a start date and end date. This enables forward planning of changes and is vital for enterprise- class deployments.\n\n\u25a0\n\nMarketing rules \u2014 Rules maintained by business users in a sales agreement, offer or promotion can be injected into a product model so the options and features are\n\ndifferent for a particular marketing context. For example, a product might be available in red, blue or green, but in the context of a \u201cWinter Promotion,\u201d only red and green are available.\n\n\u25a0\n\nEngineer-to-order workflow \u2014 A work\ufb02ow that contacts engineering for approval of technical feasibility and cost estimation is supported.\n\nPricing\n\nThis capability evaluates out-of-the-box pricing that can be set up and administered by a\n\nnontechnical business user. Almost all CPQ products support formula-based pricing and scripting. Those are evaluated in the \u201cextensibility\u201d critical capability.\n\nThe following criteria were evaluated for functional completeness, usability, ease of administration and response times:\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00807121\n\nPage 38 of 51\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\n\u25a0\n\nList pricing \u2014 The administration, import and execution of list pricing is supported.\n\n\u25a0\n\nCost-plus pricing \u2014 Prices can be calculated by marking up the costs from a cost list.\n\n\u25a0\n\nMargin calculation \u2014 The difference between net price and cost is calculated as the margin.\n\n\u25a0\n\nOne-time prices \u2014 Prices can be charged one time for multiple different units of measure (for example, per unit, per case, per dozen or per ton).\n\n\u25a0\n\nVolume-based discounting \u2014 A volume discount schedule can be created and assigned to a product or product category in a price list.\n\n\u25a0\n\nAttribute-based pricing \u2014 The price of a product is a function of its attributes (such\n\nas color and size). The price adjustments/overrides for each attribute combination are de\ufb01ned in a matrix in the context of a price list.\n\n\u25a0\n\nPromotions \u2014 A promotion de\ufb01nes special terms for a targeted group of customers for a period of time. Promotions can be automatically associated with a transaction (for example, because a particular product or combination of products is added to the cart) or manually applied. A promotion could include price adjustments, shipping terms or payment terms. The system should enforce compatibility rules between promotions. Multiple promotions can be applied to a single transaction line (if\n\ncompatible).\n\n\u25a0\n\nBundle pricing \u2014 Special pricing can apply when a speci\ufb01ed combination of products is added to the cart.\n\n\u25a0\n\nCoverage pricing \u2014 The price of a service may be some function of the price of other products that it covers. For example, the price of a consumer electronics warranty is 10% of the net price of the products covered.\n\n\u25a0\n\nSales tax \u2014 An estimate of sales tax is calculated during quoting or order capture. Sales tax can be calculated either from internal rate tables or via a call to an external sales tax system, such as Avalara.\n\n\u25a0\n\nIntegration with an external rating service \u2014 The system can customize a real-time call to an external pricing engine where needed.\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00807121\n\nPage 39 of 51\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\n\u25a0\n\nPrice explanation \u2014 An explanation of how each price was calculated can be displayed to the user. This should call out how the list price was calculated and list any on-invoice or off-invoice discounts that were applied. The cost and margin should also be displayed.\n\n\u25a0\n\nDate effectivity \u2014 All pricing rules support a start date and end date. This enables administrators to set up changes in advance and is important for enterprise-class deployments of CPQ.\n\n\u25a0\n\nHeadless pricing \u2014 Pricing logic can be called via an API by any external application.\n\nExtra credit for showing a live customer example.\n\nLong-Term Deal Negotiation\n\nThe vendor supports negotiating a long-term agreement between a vendor and its B2B customer for an extended period, covering multiple transactions. This might be one project, an annual or a multiyear agreement.\n\nUpfront discounts, long-term volume discounts, rebates, shipping terms, payment terms, volume commitments, marketing development funds and other types of commitments and incentives should be supported in a single contract. The terms of the contract must be automatically enforced when quoting and ordering.\n\nThe following criteria were evaluated for functional completeness, usability, ease of\n\nadministration and response times:\n\n\u25a0\n\nContract for long-term agreement \u2014 Capture all facets of a long-term trading relationship between the vendor and another party in a contract with effective dates.\n\n\u25a0\n\nPrice discounts for product category/line \u2014 Capture and automatically apply price discounts at the product line/category level. Users should be able to de\ufb01ne exceptions at the subcategory or product level.\n\n\u25a0\n\nPrice discounts for product \u2014 Capture and automatically apply price discounts at the product level.\n\n\u25a0\n\nPrice discounts for shipping \u2014 Capture and automatically apply price discounts for\n\nshipping.\n\n\u25a0\n\nPrice discount volume commitments \u2014 Capture and automatically apply a volume discount schedule for a product line/category or product.\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00807121\n\nPage 40 of 51\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\n\u25a0\n\nIntelligent price discount guidance \u2014 Use AI to recommend the best discounts for a\n\ncustomer; for example, based on willingness to pay, long-term order history, account strategy.\n\n\u25a0\n\nRebates \u2014 De\ufb01ne off-invoice rebates for product lines/categories or products.\n\n\u25a0\n\nCustomer-specific product configurations \u2014 De\ufb01ne product con\ufb01gurations that are speci\ufb01c to this customer that can be quickly selected by a user ordering for the customer.

Strategic level: Organizations fail to recognize that digital commerce is a team sport that requires cross-organizational efforts to deliver business outcomes. As a result, they don\u2019t establish a long-term roadmap for business model evolution or continual architecture changes.\n\n2. Operational level: Organizations fail to identify the root cause of underperformance at the operational level, which can involve lack of operational expertise or poorly designed customer experience. Gartner estimates that operations (including marketing, merchandising, customer service and logistics) and customer experience account for over 70% of digital commerce business outcomes.\n\n3. Development level: Digital commerce platforms involve an ecosystem of integrated applications and are complex to develop. Without using product management and agile approaches, application leaders might disappoint on the time it takes to get a project up and running, or could deploy something that does not meet expectations.\n\nThis research advises application leaders on a framework to develop the digital commerce strategy using a cyclical approach that addresses the above three challenges (see Figure 1).\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00378720\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\nPage 3 of 19\n\nFigure 1. Developing a Digital Commerce Strategy\n\nSource: Gartner (March 2019)\n\nThe process begins by setting up a cross-functional team (Step 1) that includes business (sales, marketing and merchandising, for example), IT and operations (including customer service, store operation, supply chain and logistics). For organizations with mature IT development and operational capabilities, a key part of this step is to establish a mechanism for digital product management that underpins the entire strategy process. Organizations with digital ambitions need to change from the \u201cproject\u201d mindset to \u201cproduct management\u201d approach where they enable ongoing management of digital products to meet changing customer expectations.\n\nThe cyclical approach includes three nested cycles as shown in Figure 1:\n\n1. Strategize: Covers the complete cycle from Step 2 through to Step 7. This applies to cases when organizations are doing digital commerce for the first time, as well as when they are revisiting the strategy.

Optimize: Covers Steps 3, 5, 6 and 7. This cycle enables organizations to improve operational practices and customer experience on an ongoing basis. It identifies ideas and areas for customer experience improvement, leading to refinement of operational processes, the development of new features, and allows the monitoring and testing of such new capabilities. This cycle takes place frequently, as often as every two to four weeks, when operational improvement is needed.\n\n3. Deliver: Covers the cycle from Steps 5, 6 and 7, and incorporates DevOps into the development process to enable fast and high-quality product delivery using agile methodologies. It links development and operations, and automates processes such as releases, integration and testing. This cycle takes place continuously on a daily or weekly basis.\n\nApplication leaders can use this framework to develop and refine their digital commerce strategies. It makes sense to formalize the strategy with a written document during this exercise, or after completing the initial cycle. This would outline the organization, the business model roadmap, KPIs and customer experience, and would describe the three cycles and the mechanisms that trigger each cycle. Having a formalized strategy document provides a clear, referenceable record of the agreed way toward digital business.\n\nStep 1: Establish a Cross-Functional Team That Embraces Product Management Practices\n\nDigital Commerce can be led from several parts of an organization, including marketing, IT, sales, a specific line of business, or top-down from a senior role such as CEO. A key to success is to have a cross-functional commerce team of business and technical stakeholders, which can sometimes be managed via a new role such as chief digital officer (CDO) or VP of digital.\n\nDigital commerce operational teams should not be siloed from the teams responsible for developing and operating the commerce platform (if in-house). A proven discipline that bridges the gaps between operational business and IT is the concept of product management. Digital platforms should be thought of as \u201cproducts\u201d and, like any other product sold by an organization, the goal is to provide technology and experiences for customers to grow the business. There are several ways to organize the operational, product, and delivery teams within a commerce organization, and how they relate to operational IT. A recommended approach for delivery teams is to embrace the concept of DevOps, and make sure the DevOps team is part of (or very closely aligned to) the development team.\n\nDevOps fundamentally changes the relationship between product delivery and operational IT. Instead of IT being a \u201cwall\u201d that code is thrown over, DevOps processes work alongside delivery and product management processes.\n\nOperational IT then becomes a horizontal support system underlying and supporting all parts of the commerce organization (see Figure 2).\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00378720\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\nPage 5 of 19\n\nFigure 2. High-Level Organization for Digital Commerce\n\nSource: Gartner (March 2019)\n\nProduct managers should have both business and technical skill sets.

    "content": " Solution). Organizations should understand that developing and managing digital commerce is not a single project and requires ongoing innovation and improvement.\n\nThis is the core reason for the nested cyclical strategy approach Gartner recommends, which incorporates three processes:\n\n1. Product management (strategize)\n\n2. Agile development (optimize)\n\n3. DevOps/continuous delivery (deliver)\n\nSee \u201cFrom Projects to Products \u2014 Three Essential Actions for Every CIO Aiming to Transform Their Digital Organizations\u201d and \u201cDesign an Effective Organization for Digital Commerce\u201d for more information.\n\nStep 2: Define the Business\n\nDefine Business Objectives and Measurement\n\nOrganizations launch digital commerce for various reasons, and typical motivations include:\n\n\u25a0\n\nImproving customer experience\n\nPage 6 of 19\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00378720\n\n\u25a0\n\nIncreasing digital revenue\n\n\u25a0 Reaching new customers or markets\n\n\u25a0 Reducing costs by shifting to digital channels\n\n\u25a0 Optimizing or transforming the business\n\nBusiness objectives influence the selection of top-level KPIs. For example, to improve customer experience, Net Promoter Score or other customer satisfaction metrics are often used. To increase digital revenue, data from digital sales or the contributions of the digital channel is often tapped. It is important to set milestone targets for measurement, and track digital commerce performance accordingly.\n\nApplication leaders should translate KPIs for different levels of employees that include senior management, middle management and operational and technical staff so that everyone is clear about the metrics that matter the most.\n\nIt is essential to be careful when selecting KPIs so that they are not rewarding behaviors that can have unintended or negative consequences. For example, organizations wanting to increase digital revenue might still use total sales placed through salespeople as their key metric, on which sales commission is calculated. This will lead to salespeople swaying customers to placing orders through them instead of online, causing the digital channel to underperform. Instead, organizations should align salespeople\u2019s incentives and reward them for helping customers to register and place orders online.\n\nIn addition to KPIs for the business unit and employees, application leaders also need to establish a dashboard for technical performance to ensure that the digital commerce platform is functioning as intended, and that metrics you cannot afford to damage are protected. For example, you should check that pages are loaded quickly and properly, that links from search results or campaigns can direct visitors to the correct content, and that mobile apps can be installed on major OS and phone models and can work with limited bandwidth. See \u201cHow to Manage Digital Commerce Metrics\u201d and \u201cHow to Manage Customer Experience Metrics\u201d for more information.\n\nBuild a Digital Business Model Roadmap\n\nBusiness objectives and target measurement can both impact the choice of business models. For example, if the goal is to \u201cgrow digital sales contribution to 20% of total revenue in five years,\u201d organizations may continue with existing product offerings and business model, and achieve the target by continuously improving operations and customer experience. In this case, they are optimizing the business by",

But if the organization wants to grow that contribution to 50% in the same time frame, this will likely require launching new product s or adopting new business models that are underpinned by digital technologies. This is closer to digital transformation. Gartner has identified six types of new business models beyond those commonly seen for digital commerce that move digital commerce toward digital businesses (see Figure 3 and \u201cScaling Digital Commerce Into a Digital Platform Business\u201d).\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00378720\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\nPage 7 of 19\n\nFigure 3. Business Models Moving Digital Commerce Toward Digital Business\n\nSource: Gartner (March 2019)\n\nApplication leaders need to consider which of these models can be applied to their products, and how they can complement any existing business model.\n\nOrganizations can use multiple business models for various markets or product offerings. They can maintain the existing business model and add new ones for selective product offerings or new digital business ambitions.\n\nAt this stage it is important to build a roadmap of digital business models and understand how each business model maps to your offerings and digital business blueprint. Part of the business model exercise is to define the products and services to be offered, customer segments and geographic markets to target, and channels to support.\n\nTo support this exercise, you need to ask the following questions:\n\n\u25a0 Products and services: What product categories shall we include? Do we want to have\n\nproducts that are exclusively available through the online channel? Shall we bundle solutions? How do we identify product correlation for recommendations?\n\n\u25a0 Geographies: Which regions/markets shall we cover? Shall we use digital channels to further\n\npenetrate existing markets, or to reach new markets?\n\nPage 8 of 19\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00378720\n\n\u25a0 Customer segments: What customer/industry segments shall we target? What\u2019s the target size\n\n(in terms of revenue, number of products, brands and employees) of our customers?\n\n\u25a0 Channels: Which channels shall we cover (for example, online, mobile, store, kiosks, social, IoT devices or chatbots) and how should those channels integrate with each other? Do we rely on stand-alone sites or sell through marketplaces as well?\n\n\u25a0\n\nTime to market: When will we launch the pilot? When will we go live?\n\nStep 3: Design the Customer Experience\n\nOnce the business has been defined, the digital commerce team should work on designing the customer experience supporting the business model.\n\nDesign for a Unified Experience Throughout the Customer Journey and Life cycle\n\nA common mistake organizations make is to look at customer experience in a piecemeal fashion, and deploy trendy but tactical technologies without taking into account the entire customer journey. Customers go through multiple steps during the online purchase journey that may involve multiple processes (such as research, evaluation, online check-out, arranging pick-up from a store, calling a service center for installation, and order returns). Organizations should design for a unified and continuous experience throughout the customer journey as they move between channels and across processes.\n\nThe full customer life cycle spans both the \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201cown\u201d stages, and a positive experience here will increase loyalty, which leads to the further purchases, and helps spread via word of mouth to other potential customers.

For example, a consumer goods company might plan to offer automatic product replenishment via connected devices as part of a \u201cproduct as a service\u201d business model. Figure 4 shows these functions and services during the eight processes of the customer journey.\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00378720\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\nPage 9 of 19\n\nFigure 4. Design a Unified Customer Experience Example: Automatic Product Replenishment\n\nFAQ = frequently asked questions; SOE = search engine optimization; SEM = search engine marketing\n\nSource: Gartner (March 2019)\n\nEach dot on Figure 3 represents a function or service that helps customers achieve a task during the journey, and there are multiple tasks in this example such as online purchase, device installation and activation. Many of these functions are not handled by the digital commerce platform, and some are covered by functions such as marketing, merchandising, customer service and fulfillment. Application leaders need to see the whole customer journey and life cycle to design the interactions between digital commerce and adjacent applications and processes, and to offer a unified experience that enables customers to transact and complete tasks with minimal effort.\n\nPrioritize Improvement Initiatives Based on Business Outcomes and Customer Benefits\n\nCustomer experience improvement is an ongoing process, and it can be overwhelming to work on all the above eight processes at the same time. Organizations should prioritize initiatives based on impact to digital commerce performance and customer benefits. For example, organizations that are suffering from low conversion or high bounce rates can focus on the \u201cevaluate\u201d and \u201cpurchase\u201d steps that directly impact those metrics. In the case of product replenishment, where customer experience hinges on ongoing service and maintenance, the \u201conboard\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d processes should have high priority.\n\nStart by fixing anything that is broken. Then focus on the top processes that impact most (such as more than 80%) of the digital commerce experience throughout the customer life cycle. Select different processes to work on each year, and rotate between them depending on their priority.\n\nPage 10 of 19\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00378720\n\nOperationalize this practice within the organization as this often requires collaboration from other functional departments such as marketing and customer service (see \u201cHow to Prioritize Customer Experience Projects\u201d).\n\nLeverage the Data Analytics Infrastructure for Superior Customer Experience\n\nMaking the customer experience effortless helps to improve customer loyalty, and relies on deep customer insight. It means that customers don\u2019t have to identify themselves or repeat their stories at every touchpoint. Leading organizations are working on a \u201csingle view of the customer\u201d by connecting data from various sources to enrich the customer profile and interaction history. This is an ongoing effort that requires cross-functional collaboration, a modern data analytics infrastructure (to consolidate scattered data), and data governance (to ensure data quality and consistency).

They can also help to enrich the customer data.\n\nMore importantly, application leaders should use corporate-level data analytics to gather valuable customer insight. Working with business leaders, they should identify datasets that are of higher value, have less \u201cnoise,\u201d and that correlate closely with performance. They should consider using deep learning techniques, either in-house or from vendors, to uncover knowledge about customers so that they can allocate resources more effectively. Such insights will feed into the customer experience redesign efforts for continuous improvement.\n\nMonitor Innovation, Competition and Business Performance for Improvement Ideas\n\nApplication leaders need to keep abreast of the latest innovations in customer-facing technologies, and what the competition is doing to improve customer experience. Select those that make sense for your business and that bring benefits to customers. Work with the testing team to understand the impact on existing customer experience before rolling out to the wider customer base.\n\nA key criteria is whether the technology helps reduce customer efforts. Don\u2019t deploy new technologies just for innovation\u2019s sake, as sometimes they can make the customer experience more cumbersome.\n\nOperations should continuously monitor digital commerce performance from both the business and technical aspects. This is another source of improvement ideas. For example, when conversion rates remain low, it calls for investigation into multiple areas such as UI design, check-out flow, pricing strategy, product description, search relevancy, payment acceptance and online help. Customer experience design and improvement is an ongoing process and needs to be reviewed frequently by looking into the above-mentioned areas.\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00378720\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\nPage 11 of 19\n\nStep 4: Define the Architecture\n\nBusiness model and customer experience decisions impact the choice of the architecture, which is closely related to customer experience \u2014 especially UI design.

The Toolkit includes a vendor questionnaire that will help you to define the functional capabilities of the platform, and compare vendor offerings. The spreadsheet contains a modifiable, detailed list of more than 1,000 product features and functions, including both core functionalities and ecosystem applications. You can add or delete features from the list based on your specific requirements.\n\nDeployment Models\n\nA digital commerce solution can use one of four deployment models, or hybrids of several of them:\n\n\u25a0 Custom development: An in-house-developed platform where the organization and/or software development partner builds, operates and maintains the solution by itself.\n\n\u25a0\n\nLicensed software: Software bought from a vendor, and hosted on-premises or by a third party.\n\n\u25a0\n\nSaaS: Vendor-managed cloud offering that may be shared with other vendor clients (known as multitenant).\n\n\u25a0\n\nFully outsourced: The vendor provides the solution and manages all operations, including the website, fulfillment, logistics, digital marketing and customer service.\n\nPage 14 of 19\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00378720\n\nA SaaS platform may suffice for simple business models and functional requirements. Delivery of the SaaS platform usually involves a product catalog feed, order integration and decisions on configurable features for the storefront. More-complex business models or functional requirements usually call for a \u201cbuy and build\u201d approach that integrates products from several vendors, plus a level of extension or customization. For more information on deployment models, see \u201cUse Three Criteria to Evaluate Digital Commerce Cloud Strategies.\u201d\n\nUse Bimodal to Integrate Commerce With Legacy Applications\n\nDigital commerce initiatives rarely end in a \u201ckeeping the lights on\u201d mode, as customer expectations and technology innovation move at a rapid pace. When a commerce platform is the basis for a digital product, the agile methodology should be utilized while maintaining architectural governance of the roadmap developed in Step 4. However, system-of-record IT applications may be managed using waterfall development methodologies.\n\nBringing together agile and waterfall methodologies requires time from business and technical stakeholders who may need to be educated about the processes, and have the commitment to collaborate with digital commerce application leaders.\n\n\u201cDigital\u201d is often about product management and agility, is often a mix of systems of differentiation and innovation, and is managed using Mode 2. Systems of record, on the other hand, are often managed using Mode 1, and might include ERP, CRM, OMS, warehouse, in-store technologies and production processes depending on the type of organization. The two modes need careful management and coordination to work together. This is because the integration of systems of record are not always compatible with digital development of the commerce platform, therefore a more-sequential (waterfall) process may be required to align resources and timelines. See \u201cIncrease Agility With Bimodal IT and a Pace-Layered Application Strategy\u201d for explanation of the two modes.\n\nStep 6: Deploy Continuously\n\nGoing live with a digital commerce platform is the first major step.

No tools can accomplish DevOps if these things are not in place.\n\nThe \u201cDevOps toolchain\u201d (see Figure 6) is a set of technologies and processes that make DevOps happen. The main focus of this toolchain is to make new functionality quickly available for production. Fully functional, new code can be integrated, an environment provisioned and configured, the code deployed, applications started, test scripts run and reports generated \u2014 all automatically. Deployment is not always to production \u2014 the goal of continuous delivery can operate at several levels, and many businesses and platforms chose to \u201cbundle\u201d such deliveries onto less-frequent production deployments (see \u201cHow to Navigate Your DevOps Journey\u201d).\n\nFigure 6. The DevOps Toolchain Continuum\n\nSource: Gartner (March 2019)\n\nContinuous integration and deployment is the ideal goal, and most organizations and indeed software companies remain on this journey. A large amount of work needs to be put into getting all of these components working well together. Only then can the benefits be transformational in reducing human workload, error rates and security risks, and therefore improving speed to market in the longer run. However, it is a daunting challenge for an organization to build DevOps internally as part of a digital commerce platform strategy if digital commerce is their first digital initiative.\n\nApplication leaders should assess their organizations\u2019 IT maturity and long-term confidence in funding such an approach. Those using a development partner should look for pre-existing maturity\n\nPage 16 of 19\n\nThis research note is restricted to the personal use of .\n\nGartner, Inc. | G00378720\n\nin this capability (see \u201c10 Key Attributes for Selecting a Digital Commerce Service Provider\u201d).

Step 2 defines operational metrics linked to business outcomes, and application leaders can further refine those and include those in the dashboard so that operational staff can be alerted when key metrics break thresholds. Operational monitoring includes application performance monitoring (APM), which can monitor the browser and application to detect issues, for instance during peak activities. Regular operational testing can include penetration testing and other forms of security testing, and \u201csmoke\u201d testing of core user journeys. Digital experience monitoring (DEM) can help to detect user experience issues and determine causes, including browser-specific issues.\n\nOther functional departments can also monitor and test applications related to digital commerce. For example, marketing could constantly monitor services and applications for the purposes of retargeting, search engine marketing, social media tracking, personalization engines and campaign management. Customer service can monitor call quality, engage in chat sessions, and conduct customer satisfaction surveys. They can both use customer journey analytics to monitor customer experience.\n\nApplication leaders should be aware of the monitoring and testing activities carried out by other teams, and plan for improvements based on the insights garnered from this monitoring into the digital commerce release cycles. These aggregated insights should further feed into the customer experience improvement processes in Step 3.\n\nDelivery cycle monitoring and testing is an essential part of product management where development quickly tests and refines new ideas and prototypes, and moves them toward release.\n\nStep 7 provides quality assurance to development, and is the control point where a new function is released or returned to development. Application performance monitoring, as well as load and stress testing in this stage, is also critical to ensuring the stability and resilience of the platform during peak production activity.

Several other Merchant of Record (MoR) providers are going headless and focusing on the backend functions such as payments, order management, chargeback handling and VAT settlement or ad\u2010 vice depending on the business model used. So, it is not as much of a headless solution as it is loosely coupled e\u2010commerce platform.\n\nHeadless does not mean brainless as this approach actually allows companies to increase focus on building more intelligence into the core back\u2010end engine.

Mo\u2010 bile is continuously increasing its share. Data from recent Black Friday sales points to a 70% share for mobile phones with desktops, laptops and even tablets losing share of transactions. On the horizon is the emergence of \u2018voice commerce\u2019 thru devices such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home. In Asia there is significant growth in \u201cassisted com\u2010 merce\u201d with chat supporting or completing the buying journey.

For example, new currencies, new logos can be introduced on a trial basis for a specific UX channel. Companies also gain the ability for faster testing of concepts through mechanisms such as A/B Testing. For example, commerce leaders are continuously testing, measuring and adjusting their front\u2010end solu\u2010 tions.

Go-to-market\n\nleaders who don\u2019t stay on top of changing buyer behaviors and adapt their routes-to-\n\nmarket strategies risk irrelevance in today\u2019s highly competitive buying landscape. For\n\ndecades, offline routes and offline sales channels that facilitate transactions through\n\nsuppliers\u2019 direct sales teams and channel partners have dominated B2B selling\n\nstrategies. However, with digital transformation revolutionizing B2B commerce and\n\nelevating buyer preferences for self-service, go-to-market leaders must reevaluate the\n\nbest routes for selling to their target buyers. These routes to market include:\n\nDirect offline. A supplier sells products or services directly to buyers through an\n\noffline (i.e., human) sales team without intermediaries.\n\nIndirect offline. A supplier sells products or services to buyers through one or\n\nmore third party\u2019s offline sales team, such as value-added resellers, distributors,\n\nand agents/brokers.\n\nDirect digital.

Leaders must consider the following forces that are\n\nactively shaping B2B buying:\n\nDigital-first experiences and younger buyers. The most powerful force driving digital sales channel adoption is a fundamental shift in buyer demographics, preferences, and behavior. In Forrester\u2019s Buyers\u2019 Journey Survey, 2025, 68% of\n\nsurveyed business buyers with purchases $1 million or greater were Millennials or\n\nmembers of Generation Z. These buyers are digital natives and strongly prefer\n\ndigital self-service channels. For example, 49% of Millennial and Gen Z business\n\nbuyers used a digital transaction method for their most recent initial purchase. B2B\n\nsuppliers must offer personalized, digital experiences or risk being eliminated for\n\nconsideration when these buyers are drivers in the buying group, especially as\n\ngenAI reshapes the buying process.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Forrester Research, Inc.

Their main advantage is automating and\n\nstandardizing purchasing workflows, reducing processing times, and ensuring contract\n\ncompliance for both buyers and suppliers. For suppliers, while they can be\n\noperationally complex, these systems provide predictable, high-volume orders from\n\nestablished customers. An example is SAP Ariba, used primarily by major global\n\nenterprises such as Walmart and UnitedHealth Group. Another example is Coupa\n\nProcurement, which is widely used by mid-to-large enterprises prioritizing real-time\n\nspend visibility, such as NVIDIA and Schneider Electric.\n\nCategory 2: Supplier-Operated Channels\n\nThis category encompasses digital sales channels owned and controlled by a supplier,\n\ndesigned to acquire and sell to buyers directly. Their key advantage is that they allow\n\nthe supplier to maintain full control over product assortment, branding, user\n\nexperience, pricing, customer data, analytics and insights, as well as the transaction\n\nprocess.\n\nSupplier-operated e-commerce.

Digital-native\n\nbuyers in growing numbers will demand choice in how they buy, intuitive and value-rich\n\nexperiences, and offers and pricing that are optimized for them. Technology and\n\nrevenue operations leaders should weigh and prioritize relevant capabilities and use\n\ncases and align them with market trends in their industry, business needs, their existing\n\ntechnology stack, and customer expectations.\n\nCPQ solutions customers using this evaluation to inform a purchase decision should\n\nconsider:\n\nThe industry-specific needs, business model, and offerings. Prioritize\n\nrequirements to help align to vendor capabilities. For example, software-as-a-\n\nservice (SaaS) businesses must configure and price any combination of perpetual,\n\nsubscription, and consumption-based services and manage customer assets\n\nacross their lifecycle; customized product manufacturers need 2D/3D product\n\nvisualization and a scalable configurator for fast response times with complex\n\nproducts; cloud and managed service providers must manage complex post-order\n\nfulfillment workflows; and price-volatile industries like wholesale distribution and\n\nhigh tech may need pricing optimization.\n\nYour omnichannel market coverage focus. Supporting the extensibility of CPQ services via API calls to an e-commerce site or a partner portal is essential to supporting the mix of direct sellers, self-service buyers, and channel partners like\n\nresellers and distributors. This functionality allows organizations to scale globally\n\nwith a common product catalog, configurator engine, and pricing rules that are\n\ndecoupled from the front end and extended to personalized sales portals and\n\nmarketplaces. Deploy rebate management to incent partners and manage rebates.\n\nHow to integrate and streamline revenue processes. Assess the current\n\ninfrastructure and integration needed with your CRM, enterprise resource planning\n\n(ERP), e-commerce, and other revenue lifecycle management systems like contract\n\nlifecycle management, order management, and billing management, or computer-\n\naided design (CAD)/product lifecycle management (PLM) for ",

Whether evaluating a new set of potential CPQ suppliers or reassessing an existing relationship, this guide contains essential elements to understand the capability range and benefits of modern CPQ solutions.\n\nThis Buyer\u2019s Guide highlights current and future CPQ market dynamics and provides analysis and MGI 360 Ratings\u2122 of the 25 most consequential vendors in this space. This report also includes four MGI MarketLens\u2122 charts: a set of proprietary lenses highlighting how solu- tions compare in terms of their agility, ability to handle business complexity, and support for volume, go-to-market strength, and solution strength. The MGI MarketLens helps buyers construct a shortlist of potential suppliers, compare an existing CPQ implementation with potential alternatives, and understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of solutions; it also gives vendors a tool for benchmarking their performance in these key areas.\n\n\n\nSalesforce achieved the highest overall MGI 360 Rating\u2122 of 61 with a neutral analyst outlook.\n\n\n\nTacton attained the highest rating in the Product pillar.\n\n\n\nAll 15 vendors rated in the CPQ Top 25 Buyer\u2019s Guide re- ceived a neutral analyst outlook. CPQ solutions are still in relatively early stages of maturity evolution.\n\nOracle and Conga are the highest-rated suppliers in the HyperScale market segment.\n\nWorkday is the highest-rated supplier in the Enterprise market segment.\n\nCPQ Vendors Under Coverage\n\nThe CPQ Top 25 Buyer\u2019s Guide provides ratings and analysis of the 25 most significant suppliers of CPQ solutions. It includes MGI 360 Ratings\u2122 of 15 suppliers and analysis of 10 honorable mention vendors. According to MGI Research, these are the most significant solutions and suppliers in the market today. Only the top vendors are included in this report. MGI 360 Ratings are calculated via a rigorous quantitative rating (scored 0-100). MGI 360 Rated\u2122 suppliers are also given a letter grade based on quartile rating results, as well as a qualitative analyst outlook (positive, neutral, or negative). The 15 vendors receiving full 360 Ratings, letter grades, and analyst outlooks are: CloudSense, Conga, DealHub, Epicor, Experlogix, Logik.io, Oracle, PROS, Revalize, Salesforce, SAP, ser- vicePath, Tacton, Workday, and Zuora. The 10 suppliers receiving honorable mention, but not rated for this report, are: Cincom, Expedite Commerce, Infor, Oracle NetSuite, Pricefx, Salesbricks, Subskribe, Veloce, Vendavo, and Zilliant. MGI Research tracks approximately 30 more vendors in this space and reserves the right to publish ratings and analyses on select vendors as deemed worthy and appropriate.\n\n1\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinions furnished on an as-is basis.

When deployed successfully, CPQ tools deliver a host of very real business benefits and are among the most compelling business application software investments a company can make. But the way software products are bought and sold is changing rapidly. To remain competitive, sellers must meet and ex- ceed rising buyer expectations. This typically entails delivery of a frictionless, automated buying process that provides the buyer with agency, offers a differentiated solution, and is priced to win. The good news: the market for CPQ solutions is deep \u2013 there is a tool for nearly every type of requirement, and impressive innovation is taking place. The bad news: CPQ is a highly fragmented market, and the risk of making the wrong choice is high.\n\nKey Issues for CPQ\n\nWhat is the business case for CPQ?\n\nWhat are the emerging CPQ require- ments?\n\nToday\u2019s Sales Challenges\n\nWhat are the best practices for improv- ing the automation of configure, price, quote tools?\n\nSellers today are faced with multiple, often conflicting, business challenges. First, prospects and customers don\u2019t necessarily want to talk to sellers, even in complex B2B scenarios. Survey data indicate that nearly 50% of buyers never want to interact with a salesperson. Second, in commodity markets that lack clear product differentiation, the sales process and its attributes \u2013 like speed, convenience, transparency, flexibility \u2013 are the only ways to differentiate a brand and can spell the difference between leading the market or struggling to survive. Third, sales talent is difficult to attract and retain; most companies have sales teams made up of largely average sales performers.\n\nWhat is the role of CPQ in an Agile Monetization Platform and an organi- zation\u2019s ability to monetize?\n\nWhat is driving demand for CPQ solu- tions?\n\nTo address these challenges, sellers need a tool to automate the sale of custom offers and product/service configurations at scale. In fiercely competitive markets where winning and retaining accounts is a battle, or- ganizations need to be confident that promises can be produced, delivered, and implemented on time, as spec- ified, and at or above the buyer\u2019s expectations. This starts by giving the sales organization, including channel partners, a modern set of tools to improve the performance of the average salesperson. The only way to manage increasingly complex product, services, and pricing configurations is via intelligent automation, and delivering a custom, differentiated customer experience is quickly becoming table stakes. In slow-growth markets, reve- nue growth comes from existing customers. And earning the right to sell more into the existing customer base requires a delightful \u2013 or at least frictionless \u2013 buying experience.\n\nWhat are the best practices for select- ing a CPQ tools vendor and achieving implementation success?\n\nHow is the market for CPQ evolving?\n\nHow will AI impact CPQ solutions?\n\nWhich suppliers will emerge as the leaders in CPQ?\n\n4\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinions furnished on an as-is basis.

Employee turnover is over 30% in many industries. Finding competent sales talent requires time and resource.

By definition, market leaders have lower involuntary employee churn, longer-tenured sales organizations, and higher customer satisfaction. This can be achieved, in part, by 1) providing the sales organization with productivity tools that increase the effectiveness of new hires, and 2) automating the tasks that distract sales teams from actually selling, thus increasing the overall sales capacity. The sales team that can quote faster has more time to sell. Shortening sales cycles also lowers the risk of an individual on the buyer\u2019s side leaving before the deal is closed. Time kills deals.\n\nWhat is CPQ?\n\nConfigure Price Quote is a software discipline that enables companies to automate complex sales processes. It is typically packaged as a mini-suite of related capabilities enabling precise product configuration, accurate pricing, and rapid quote presentation across all types of channels \u2013 direct, indirect, partner/re- seller, self-service, guided e-commerce, and OEMs. A very basic example of CPQ capability is checking prerequisites and anti-requisites for an offering, e.g., if someone signs up for a cable service subscription, delivery of the service requires a cable box.\n\nCPQ solutions promise a smooth end-to-end customer experience, reduced friction in the sales process, and improved precision and accuracy of product combinations, pricing, terms, and conditions. When properly implemented, CPQ reduces the possibility of quote rejection due to human error. It makes the sales channel smarter and faster, and makes the sales process and downstream outcomes more predictable.\n\nCPQ allows mass customization of relatively complex product lineups, enabling channels to sell complex products at scale. This applies to a broad range of product types \u2013 from digital subscriptions and financial services to cars and wind turbines. CPQ has applications in a broad spectrum of industries and business models across a range of stages of maturity: B2B and B2C, physical, digital, and hybrid combinations of goods and services, across myriad channel combina- tions.\n\nThe market for CPQ solutions is highly fragmented. MGI Research has identified over 250 providers of CPQ software and actively tracks more than 50. This Buyer\u2019s Guide is focused on the most important providers of CPQ software in the market today. It is exhaustive in terms of its analysis of the vendors covered, but it does not attempt to analyze every single provider. Further, this report intentionally does not go into depth on the pricing-first solutions. Several are\n\n5\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinion furnished on an as-is basis.

CPQ solutions are still in relatively early stages of product maturity evolution. Despite a nearly 50-year history, the CPQ market lacks a proven implementation methodology, beyond simple configuration of a CPQ software component, that touches key business processes for pricing, product catalog, and quoting best practices.\n\nTo understand this market, buyers must consider the specific CPQ application(s) their organization requires \u2013 does the use case call for a highly-agile, mass- market solution? Or do their specifications and use cases necessitate a vertically-oriented solution that requires highly skilled implementation and admin- istration resources? CPQ is not a single market, but three distinct submarkets: C, P, and Q. MGI Research will publish an in-depth analysis of pricing-focused solutions in 2025.\n\nCONFIGURE: At the core of CPQ is the configuration capability \u2013 the ability to check if order components fit with one other, fit against the installed product base, and can work within constraints of cost, time, availability, export regimes, manufacturing plans, and more. As one might expect, product configurators first gained traction in industries with highly complex product configurations \u2013 e.g., manufacturing and insurance. Nearly every industry has since increased in product complexity and most attempt to create custom solutions for each customer. As a result, demand for configurators has grown significantly.\n\nPRICE",

But in MGI\u2019s view, this component supports several functions, including but not limited to accuracy, margin enhancement, revenue management, demand sensing, and price optimization. Just getting an accurate set of price books and ensuring that prices are consistently based on policies and established rules and contracts is a huge step forward for most companies. This reduces custom, one-off deals, reduces unnecessary discounting, and prevents revenue leakage. Getting pricing right can help companies improve revenues from 3% to 7%. Consistent margin improvement positively impacts shareholder value. Price optimization has real applications for commodity industries and products, and it is a gamechanger when executed correctly. The key is: 1) identifying a solution with capabilities that match the use case, and 2) the relative quality of the data on hand. Price optimization promises and expectations don\u2019t always match with the initial results at the time of go-live. It is crucial to square expectations with reality and recognize that price optimization is a continuous process.\n\nQUOTE: Quoting solutions aim to transform the quality and speed of the quotation process \u2013 namely, capturing the elements a customer needs to make a decision and presenting them in a way that makes it easy to say yes. Today\u2019s state of the art has progressed far beyond the concept of a paper quote and now includes interactive, clickable, and trackable quotes with embedded data analytics, visual quote representations, animations, and quote portals. There is significant opportunity for creativity and innovations to come.\n\n6\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinions furnished on an as-is basis.

Mass-market, horizontal CPQ solutions: These have relatively rapid deployments that can be done with in-house or outsourced talent. They provide basic CPQ capability with high agility for deployment and change management, good user ergonomics, and have moderate costs that enable broad adoption. These tools are typically average across all three CPQ dimensions and undistinguished in any single area. They handle basic product bun- dling, guided selling, upsells, cross-sells, and more. Although they are low-functionality, they offer very high benefit. Being easy to use, they are quick to implement and will deliver consistent ROI.\n\n2. Capability-focused CPQ solutions: These have average-to-above-average capability in at least one or two CPQ dimensions, and often have particular strength in a single dimension. This class of CPQ products can manage complex dependencies and pricing combinations, and may even have vertical- specific product features and domain expertise.\n\n3. Vertical, industry-focused CPQ solutions: These solutions have deep product capability in one \u2013 maybe two \u2013 CPQ dimensions. They are typically\n\npurpose-built for specific verticals, e.g., commercial building products, pharmaceuticals, aerospace and defense, or automotive.\n\nCPQ tools have become a necessity for companies of all sizes. They are no longer specialized configurators for the most complex manufacturers or excep- tionally large sales organizations. To win the business of today\u2019s fickle, often overserved customers, companies need CPQ tools to differentiate their offers, increase the efficiency and efficacy of their sales channels, and grow margins while retaining existing customers. With a plethora of CPQ tools in the market, buyers are overwhelmed by choice. But these are often false choices, as not all CPQ tools are alike or even serve the same types of use cases. Deeper analysis and understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each supplier is critical.\n\nCPQ Top 25 \u2013 Why These Companies?\n\nThis report focuses on the top 25 vendors in CPQ and provides comprehensive MGI 360 Ratings\u2122 on the top 15.

These vendors are among the most conse- quential CPQ suppliers in the market and merit the attention of buyers, partners, and investors. The MGI 360 Rating methodology is quantitative in nature with a tough, nonlinear grading scale (see Appendix D for more detail). Any vendor among the 15 rated suppliers is, in our view, important and impactful, regardless of the absolute score. The 10 companies receiving honorable mention also merit user attention and may or may not receive full 360 Ratings in future evaluation cycles. The criteria for inclusion include one or more of the following:\n\nMarket visibility: The company meets one or more of the following characteristics: above-average growth, often included in longlists and shortlists of\n\n\n\nbuyer evaluations, large installed base, and/or most MGI clients express interest in the company or mention them in analyst calls. Innovation: The product has unique capabilities and the potential to disrupt the market \u2013 buyers should be aware of this product/company, even if it is not a fit for them today.\n\n7\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinion furnished on an as-is basis.

Independent of the provision (or lack thereof) of vendor references, MGI conducts its own interviews and field research on customers, partners, and investors.\n\nThere are hundreds of CPQ software providers offering products that range from basic sales quoting tools to highly sophisticated product configurators and AI-driven price optimization engines. Vendors are not excluded uniquely based on size (e.g., revenue or customer count below any threshold) or willingness to participate in the research process.\n\nInclusion in the CPQ Top 25 Buyer\u2019s Guide does not represent an endorsement or an outright recommendation to purchase a product. Conversely, exclusion of a supplier from this report is not a recommendation to exempt it from consideration. Organizations should evaluate potential suppliers both on merit and with consideration to its fit for their specific use case. Buyers should refer to Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Notes\u2122 and MGI MarketLens\u2122 charts for help determining a shortlist of suppliers to evaluate.\n\nHow to Use This Report\n\nThis report is intended to help organizations understand the business case for CPQ solutions and make more informed, cost-effective, and lower-risk decisions when it comes to evaluating suppliers and aligning business requirements with market offerings. It outlines evaluation criteria, how to justify making a new or upgraded investment in CPQ, what it takes to make a CPQ implementation successful, and analysis of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the top 25 CPQ suppliers. The research contained in this report is not a replacement for a full due diligence effort. By utilizing this Buyer\u2019s Guide, organizations can dramatically cut the time and investment needed to evaluate, source, and implement CPQ solutions.\n\nThe report utilizes structured research constructs and attributes, namely MGI 360 Ratings\u2122 and MGI MarketLens\u2122 charts. This helps buyers understand where each solution fits in terms of its applicability by use case, company/project size, and ability to serve the needs of a given buyer. MarketLens charts map various strengths and capabilities among leading CPQ vendors to help organizations narrow their selection to suppliers with the most expertise in a specific use case. Four types of MarketLens charts are included in this report:\n\nGo-to-Market Strength vs. Solution Strength: How does a supplier\u2019s functional breadth and depth compare to its ability to successfully bring the\n\nproduct to market, scale up its adoption, and grow the customer base?\n\nAgility vs. Complexity: How does a CPQ product\u2019s agility compare to its ability to handle complex quoting, configurations, and pricing scenarios? \u2022 Agility vs. Volume: How does a CPQ product\u2019s agility compare to its",

Each pillar score is sub- divided into numerous sub-categories \u2013 in total, over 150 criteria are combined to generate a single MGI 360 Rating. MGI analysts emphasize that the MGI 360 scale is very demanding; companies need to be exceptional in every aspect of their business to command higher scores.\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 MGI 360 Ratings are composed of five pillars.\n\nMGI Research assigns a letter grade of A, B+, B, or B- to all 360 Rated suppliers. Letter grades are assigned by dividing the 15 overall 360 Rating scores into four quartiles. The top-performing quar- tile receives an A grade, the second-highest rated quartile receives a B+, the third quartile re- ceives a B, and the lowest-rated quartile of CPQ suppliers receives a B-.\n\nSPEAK TO AN ANALYST: Organizations looking for additional support in crafting an evaluation strategy and conducting an independent assessment of potential suppliers should contact MGI Re- search at info@mgiresearch.com.\n\nMore information about MGI 360 Ratings\u2122 is available in Appendix D.\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 Rated suppliers are assigned letter grades by quartile\n\n9\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinion furnished on an as-is basis.

The market for CPQ solutions is highly fragmented, and suppliers typically are strong in only one or one and a half of \u201cCPQ.\u201d The market can be further distilled into segments based on agility, complexity, and volumes. Highly agile, easy to implement and maintain CPQ tools are gaining widespread adoption among small companies and within businesses that have very modest-to-low product configuration complexity. Several startups are focused on providing mass-market CPQ solutions focused on sellers of digital goods who need basic product pricing, bundling, guided selling, and integration with a contract repository. As complexity and volumes grow, these low-end tools struggle to keep pace. Conversely, sophisticated product configurators or price optimization tools are best suited for buyers with high product and pricing complexity.\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 The CPQ Market Landscape\n\nMatch suppliers\u2019 ideal use case with yours. Given the diversity of solutions and the domain expertise of the suppliers, it is critical to identify suppliers whose ideal use cases and experience are a match with yours. Some solutions/vendors excel at services CPQ (e.g., Workday), while others are a fit for manufacturing companies. A solution like Salesforce is ideally suited for broad, simple quoting needs. On the other hand, highly agile quoting solutions (e.g., DealHub, Subskribe, Veloce, Salesbricks, et al.) are appropriate for smaller organizations in need of a lightweight solution that can be implemented and managed without external resources or specialized technical skills. Each supplier brings domain expertise from their respective area of strength. Buyers should not expect the supplier to add value beyond their core \u2013 e.g., a manufacturing-oriented configurator vendor may be unlikely to bring value-add in price optimi- zation. Implementation and consulting firms should be viewed through a similar lens. If the buyer is a young, inexperienced sales organization looking for quote automation and upselling/cross-selling capabilities, with a relatively small product catalog and modest business complexity, their best fit is most likely a mass-market, high-agility CPQ product. Conversely, a buyer looking to minimize discounting, put more guardrails around one-off sales deals, and inject margin uplifts in deals should shortlist suppliers with domain expertise in price optimization.\n\nCaveat Emptor. If vendors are unable to articulate their ideal use case or make broad claims about serving the needs of very simple to extremely complex businesses, buyers need to conduct deep due diligence before engaging or risk making a costly mistake.\n\nA surge of innovation is taking place \u2013 take advantage.

Buyers should engage with these innovators, even if the startup\u2019s ability to service the buyer is in question. Sales, operations, and finance teams can learn a lot \u2013 and bring new ideas into their organizations \u2013 by understanding the state of the art in terms of innovation.

MGI field research indicates that well over 50% of Salesforce CPQ customers experienced imple- mentation time and cost overruns. This is due to a) lack of preparedness, b) wrong vendor selection, c) lack of a well-defined business process and implementation black book, and d) mismanaged implementations that fail to invest adequately in data cleanup, change management, or ongoing system admin.\n\nFlag project problems early. Surprisingly many users blame themselves, rather than the solution, when projects encounter time and cost overruns. When an implementation project status goes from green to yellow, it\u2019s time to reassess the situation. If a product is the wrong fit, it may be time to validate the vendor\u2019s claims and double-check to see if the product can handle the requisite use cases, volumes, and complexity \u2013 without consider- able customization. All too often, buyers double down and end up writing custom scripts and code when the vendor and/or systems integrator tell the customer it\u2019s their fault the CPQ system can\u2019t handle their \u201cunique\u201d requirements. While this is true in some cases, it is also true that some ven- dors will shift problems associated with their product\u2019s shortcomings onto the buyer.

Course corrections early in a CPQ project, while unpleasant, often avoid major disappointments that are both expensive and damaging to the business.\n\nClean up data and price books. Every day of data cleansing can result in two to three days\u2019 reduction in implementation time. More importantly, it increases the probability of project success. When describing CPQ implementation delays and cost overruns, customers cite dirty data, SKU sprawl, and lack of data and pricing governance as the primary causes. Investing time and resources in a detailed vendor evaluation process can save mil- lions, literally. Sharply defining use cases and identifying the appropriate suppliers are invaluable exercises. Across dozens of reference calls, users frequently blamed their own organizations for misfit solutions and cost and time overruns.\n\nVendor review sites can be dangerous and misleading. Customer feedback can be very mixed \u2013 even for a single vendor. User success with CPQ is a function of aligning specific use cases to the appropriate solution. When customer requirements are a fit for a given CPQ tool and users invest in implementation and ongoing operational success, feedback on the vendor and product tend to be very strong. Conversely, users who selected the wrong tool in the first place and who failed to adequately resource the implementation and ongoing administration describe a highly disappointing customer experience. Review sites may be free or inexpensive. The damage they can cause in a CPQ project is anything but inexpensive.\n\nKey Market Trends\n\nCPQ receives continuous investment from institutional funds and strategic buyers. Not only are early-stage startups attracting capital, some of the more mature and captive products within mega-vendors are inspiring renewed attention. The total addressable market (TAM) for CPQ is large and growing, and the core business problems being addressed are massive.\n\nConsolidation and changes in ownership: Revalize has emerged as a major consolidator of niche and legacy CPQ products and is among the hand- ful of vendors now in the hands of private equity ownership.

The damage they can cause in a CPQ project is anything but inexpensive.\n\nKey Market Trends\n\nCPQ receives continuous investment from institutional funds and strategic buyers. Not only are early-stage startups attracting capital, some of the more mature and captive products within mega-vendors are inspiring renewed attention. The total addressable market (TAM) for CPQ is large and growing, and the core business problems being addressed are massive.\n\nConsolidation and changes in ownership: Revalize has emerged as a major consolidator of niche and legacy CPQ products and is among the hand- ful of vendors now in the hands of private equity ownership. The attention of private equity investors on the CPQ space is a positive indicator of a) the size of the overall opportunity, and b) the reality that many older CPQ vendors could benefit from an infusion of upgraded, fresh talent and in- vestment capital. MGI expects more CPQ vendors will change hands in the next 12 months, as slower-moving and smaller suppliers attach them- selves to more vibrant AMP vendors with productive sales channels and the ability to bring innovation to market faster.\n\nPrice optimization increasingly looks like a distinct market: This report specifically focuses on the C and Q parts of the CPQ market. Price optimi- zation, with a distinct group of suppliers and specialized consultancies, appears more and more as a separate market with a value proposition and capabilities of its own.\n\n12\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinions furnished on an as-is basis.

CPQ solutions are fully embracing areas like commerce, billing, contract lifecycle management, and revenue recognition, and some CPQ suppliers are even marketing themselves as broader, AMP-like platforms. Conga\u2019s Revenue Lifecycle Management is an example of this marketecture. DealHub, Expedite Commerce, Subskribe, Zuora, and others share this expanded view of reaching beyond the traditional concepts of CPQ and incorporating more core quote-to-cash elements into their offerings.\n\nVisualization is becoming table stakes: One area of product capability that received considerable attention several years ago is product visualiza- tion. Companies like Threekit burst onto the CPQ scene, bringing powerful visualization tools to commerce and selling sites, along with integrations into CPQ tools. Over time, established CPQ vendors have largely caught up with the visualization-only tools, at least as far as CPQ needs are con- cerned.\n\nThe Business Case For CPQ\n\nThe business case for investing in CPQ tools is based on growing the top and/or bottom line, improving sales productivity, increasing customer satis- faction, and making the business more competitive overall through a combination of the above. Selecting an appropriate solution and managing the implementation and ongoing operations can result in above-average outcomes. However, results can vary based on the starting point and selection of the right tool. The business outcomes most impacted by a CPQ tool include:\n\nRevenue growth: CPQ tools can help with increasing the average order size and reducing the friction associated with repeat orders.\n\nMargin improvements: Modern CPQ tools\u2019 guardrails and automated recommendations enable stronger pricing and margin discipline.\n\nReduced revenue leakage: The average company leaks 2-5% of revenue. Ensuring strong connective tissue from sales quoting to contracts, billing, and operations can significantly reduce revenue leakage.\n\nSales productivity and effectivity improvements: The right CPQ tool can increase sales productivity, giving sellers more time for selling and reduc- ing the time it takes to generate and process a sales quote or order. An average or even slightly below-average salesperson can become more effec- tive, even when selling a complex product or mix of products and services. Automation of repeat orders and ability to provide customers with self- service improves sales capacity without the need for additional headcount.\n\n13\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinion furnished on an as-is basis.

In markets with increasing product parity, the time it takes to respond to customer requests can make the difference between a won or lost deal. The fastest quote (which may be the most competitive or cheapest) often wins. Every hour/day/week it takes to generate a quote increases the probability of a lost deal.\n\nImprove service level attainment: Maintaining accurate data across quotes, signed contracts, and outcomes significantly improves service delivery.\n\nQuoting precision and zero configuration errors increase trust with customers, employees, and suppliers: Improving quote accuracy and reduc- ing configuration errors improves trust with prospects and existing customers, raises the confidence of the entire organization, and makes it easier to attract good talent and partners. People want to work for and buy from companies that are easy to do business with.\n\nMore precise data to manage the business: CPQ automation enables insight into basic data (e.g., characteristics of churned accounts, better re- newal management, et al.) as well as more detailed insights (e.g., how the bill of materials (BOM) evolves from sales quote to delivery/installation to ongoing post-sales services).\n\nEnable the average sales organization to outperform: In the typical company, the top 20% of quota-carrying sales representatives outperform their objectives and produce the bulk of revenues. Getting the other 80% of sellers to attain quota consistently is the challenge. CPQ tools hold the prom- ise of making an average or below-average sales rep more productive. As a result, sales goals are more likely to be achieved, there is less turnover in the salesforce, and overall business friction is reduced considerably. Further, by automating sales for smaller accounts, low-complexity orders, and reorders by existing customers, the sales organization has more time to dedicate to larger, more lucrative accounts.\n\nMaintain/increase competitiveness: Giving customers and partners agency increases competitiveness \u2013 and reduces sales costs and improves NPS scores in the process. It makes it easier to sell into new accounts and harder for competitors to steal existing accounts.\n\nEnable AI: In practical terms, an organization must have a certain level of sales automation maturity to take advantage of AI tools. If pricing is done in spreadsheets, it will be nearly impossible to apply AI to your business. Maintaining price books in a modern, digitally accessible tool makes it pos- sible to apply a variety of AI approaches (e.g., neural networks, generative AI, and machine learning) to optimize margins, create more profitable bundles, and provide sellers with pricing that is more attractive to both the buyer and the seller.\n\n14\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinions furnished on an as-is basis.

This is a proven Microsoft-centric product configurator and quoting tool with a clearly defined target market. Customers express overall satisfaction with the company and product, although larger, higher-volume/complexity quoting performance could be improved and support for subscription price models is lacking. For customers within the target base, the company brings deep domain and product configuration experience that is consistently viewed as very good value for money. Recognized as a Microsoft-oriented company, ExperLogix also has reference customers running SAP PLM/ERP and/or Salesforce CRM with integrations into its CPQ. Experlogix sales and marketing is under-resourced compared to the capability of product and maturity of the company. This product requires minimal external resources to implement and has an attractive overall TCO.\n\nIDEAL USE CASE:\n\nMid-to-large-sized, budget-conscious companies within the heavy equipment, industrials, high tech, manufacturing, and services (for complex configured products, like elevators) verticals, particularly those sold via channel/dealer network and with a Microsoft CRM and ERP tech stack, should consider Experlogix.\n\nSPEAK TO AN ANALYST:\n\nClients are encouraged to reach out to MGI to have this research applied to their situation.

Logik.io is a headless rules engine designed for omnichannel selling with a fresh approach to product configuration. It integrates with a range of e-commerce solutions and pulls data from existing product catalogs and price books to configure and quote variable and complex, physical and digital, products and services. The company shares founders and investors with Threekit, but the two entities are run independently. Logik integrates with kBridge for CAD automation and visualization. Logik scores reflect the relative youth of the company as it works towards profitable growth.\n\nIDEAL USE CASE:\n\nB2X companies ranging in size from $100 million to $1 billion+ in revenues with complex product and services configurations, typically with omnichannel sales (direct, indirect, and online) and needing a more advanced configuration engine within a Salesforce CRM and heterogenous ERP/ecommerce infrastructure. The solution is hosted on Google Cloud and is one of the few to provide tools and a methodology for migrating off Salesforce CPQ.\n\nSPEAK TO AN ANALYST:\n\nClients are encouraged to reach out to MGI to have this research applied to their situation.

Revalize is a rollup of seven CPQ, PLM, and CAD companies in North America and Europe. This rating applies to the aggregated Revalize product lineup. Product depth, breadth, and future relevance is quite uneven across the portfolio, and the vertical industries Revalize sells into are diverse (from fluid handling to food manufacturing, facilities management, and medical devices). Several of the solutions have very deep capabilities within niche industries (e.g., fluid handling). With a leveraged balance sheet and a diverse set of software code bases, the company will be challenged to simultaneously invest in all products, retain key talent, deliver internal operational efficiencies, and maintain a competitive edge across all its markets.

With over 6,000 customers, Salesforce CPQ is the most widely sold CPQ solution in the market. In the past decade, Salesforce effectively brought CPQ to the masses and transformed sales quoting in the process. Functionally, the product is average and best suited for organizations with low-to-moderate sales complexity and modest volumes. While customer satisfaction is mixed, the product outcompetes others in its breadth and depth of integration, ecosystem, and brand visibility. In 2024, the company rebranded Revenue Lifecycle Management (RLM) to Revenue Cloud. This announcement marks the latest attempt to revitalize the CPQ brand and increase growth. While there is some market skepticism at the rate of customer adoption in RLM/Revenue Cloud, Salesforce has the resources and brand equity to significantly impact the industry. The current CPQ offerings (there are several variations) are in transition, and a newly architected version of Salesforce CPQ is being launched. Current and prospective customers should prepare for a re-implementation of Salesforce CPQ, with the associated time/expense of such endeavors. Revenue Cloud, as described today, is broad and aspirational in its functional reach.\n\nIDEAL USE CASE:\n\nDigital services-oriented, small and midsize organizations seeking to add structure and speed to quote generation and basic discipline to price management with light configuration complexity and modest volumes.\n\nSPEAK TO AN ANALYST:\n\nClients are encouraged to reach out to MGI to have this research applied to their situation.

The solution excels at managing complex pricing and intricate, high-complexity hardware, software, and services (implementation, provisioning, ongoing maintenance/support) configurations in multi-channel sales environments. Its ability to identify the \u201ccost to serve\u201d is unique, and the combination of its implementation methodology and ease of use make it possible for nontechnical users to configure and run the system with little to no external resource. The ability to pull product, pricing, specs, and marketing data from external sources is particularly valuable for resellers and MSPs generating quotes with many products/services from third-party suppliers.\n\nIDEAL USE CASE:\n\nTech service providers (TSPs, as well as MSPs and CSPs) with medium-to-high complexity and volume requirements with sophisticated, heterogeneous environments are an ideal fit. Most of its customers are using Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics for core CRM, and a variety of ERP solutions on the back end. Some use it for quoting across a federated environment of multiple CRM instances.\n\nSPEAK TO AN ANALYST:\n\nClients are encouraged to reach out to MGI to have this research applied to their situation.

The company and product excel as a configurator for engineer-to-order and configure-to-order manufacturing/industrial companies. Tacton has deep experience integrating with complex SAP engineering and manufacturing environments. It has fresh 3D and AR visual configuration and strong integration with CAD and PLM systems. Inline BOM edits, delta pricing, and pre-built integrations via Workato are notable innovations. Tacton recently launched CPQ Service Sales, enabling management of as-installed configurations. The product has a lightweight CRM built in and also integrates to Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics. The system has a flexible pricing engine, but typically base prices are mastered outside of Tacton. The product has progressed in its ease of use and manageability. User satisfaction overall is high, although some accounts have expressed interest in deeper post-sales business consulting. Tacton\u2019s partner network is quantitatively modest but qualitatively competent.\n\nIDEAL USE CASE:\n\nConfigure and engineer-to-order manufacturers with complex product requirements/variants and a primary need for a sophisticated product configurator.\n\nSPEAK TO AN ANALYST:\n\nClients are encouraged to reach out to MGI to have this research applied to their situation.

Workday\u2019s Services CPQ product, currently in the early adopter stage with approximately 20+ customers, is specifically designed to address the quoting needs of professional services organizations. The advantage of Workday\u2019s CPQ solution is its ability to abstract key elements of service delivery and its integration into Workday\u2019s PSA, HCM, and Financials offerings. The product today handles low-to-medium complexity and volumes of quotes. While it is still in an early stage of maturity, initial customers report surprisingly high satisfaction with the product due to its ability to shorten and automate the quote process, as well as improved access to more granular, relevant project data. Workday CPQ receives exceptional praise for customer attentiveness and support. Even with a young product, the customer base is already a quarter of the size of many CPQ vendors. The roadmap is ambitious; Workday is investing heavily (talent, money, and channels) to make this a strong option for pure service businesses (e.g., professional services) today, and broader use cases (e.g., tech companies selling a combination of services, physical, and digital products) in the near future.\n\nIDEAL USE CASE:\n\nMid-to-large size services organizations seeking a light-to-midweight quoting tool that integrates with financials, PSA, and HCM functionality.\n\nSPEAK TO AN ANALYST:\n\nClients are encouraged to reach out to MGI to have this research applied to their situation.

Zuora, best known for its subscription billing and revenue recognition software, offers a monetization suite that also includes payments, metering, subscriber management, and analytics built around a common monetization platform. Zuora CPQ is primarily aimed at quoting in the recurring arena and is sold exclusively as an add-on to new and existing Zuora Billing customers who rely on Salesforce for sales automation. Compared to other Zuora solutions, the CPQ product is aimed more at the basics and has gotten relatively less attention and innovation investment than other parts of the platform. Zuora CPQ can handle a long-enough list of requirements, including ramp deals, product bundles, and complex mid-cycle amendments, capabilities that many other basic quoting products struggle to support. The product is best suited for medium-to-large size enterprises who need a basic quoting tool that integrates well with subscription management tools within a Salesforce.com ecosystem.\n\nIDEAL USE CASE:\n\nMid-to-large size enterprises ($100 million to $1 billion+) seeking a simplified one-page quoting tool that integrates with full-spectrum subscription management. The product can handle medium transaction volumes and low-to-moderate quoting complexity with capabilities like ramp pricing, multi-year deals, bundles, midcycle amendments, change management, et al.\n\nSPEAK TO AN ANALYST:\n\nClients are encouraged to reach out to MGI to have this research applied to their situation.

These suppliers either have an CPQ solution or are actively working on one: Cincom, Expedite Commerce, Infor, Oracle NetSuite, Pricefx, Salesbricks, Subskribe, Veloce, Vendavo, and Zilliant. Depending on the ICP, use case, and customer need, these suppliers merit consideration.\n\nCincom / PartnerOne\n\nWith roots as a database and manufacturing systems software developer, Cincom brings decades of manufacturing and complex product sales and services experience to the CPQ market. The CPQ solution has a wide range of integrations, particularly into midmarket ERP solutions like Microsoft Dynamics, Infor, and Oracle, and notably into PLM providers like PTC, Autodesk, and SolidWorks. Cincom serves clients across Australia, France, Japan, UK, Italy, and North America, with a CPQ focus on industrial equipment manufacturing, med equipment and device manufacturing, commercial and managed services providers, and specialty vehicle manufacturers. Cincom was acquired in June 2024 by PartnerOne, a serial acquirer of enterprise software tools and applications com- panies. Cincom had approximately 400 employees and total revenues around $50 million (MGI estimate) at the time of acquisition, with CPQ representing a small portion of total sales. Given the range of tools and applications maintained by PartnerOne, Cincom CPQ\u2019s innovation roadmap is unclear. As such, prospects should evaluate Cincom CPQ on an as-is basis.\n\nProduct Name: Cincom CPQ Founded: 1968 HQ: Cincinnati, Ohio Sample Customers: Fassi, E-One, ATC, Carrier, Spirax Sarco Primary Competitors: Epicor, Experlogix, Conga, Oracle, SAP, Tacton\n\nExpedite Commerce\n\nWith roots in systems integration and sales automation, Expedite Commerce has evolved into a provider of CPQ and broader agile monetization functionality, including e-commerce, billing, contract management, and more. The primary focus is on streamlining sales quoting/contracting and sales ops with a mix of direct, indirect, and online sales motions for B2B, small-to-midsize companies and divisions of larger enterprises. The CPQ product is strongly oriented toward sales and used by business, marketing, and finance users. The company has about 60 employees, is privately held and",

Additionally, analysts assign an outlook for each company:\n\nPositive - we expect company prospects to improve \u2022 Negative - we expect company prospects to decline \u2022 Neutral - we expect company prospects to remain unchanged \u2022 Under Review \u2013 no opinion is formed yet\n\nMGI 360 Ratings and analyst outlook are compiled for a specific market. When we rate a sufficient number of companies in a given market, we publish a Market Rating Report to reflect peer group average scores.\n\nMGI 360 Ratings impose the same evaluation standard on each rated company - public or private, large or small; all are held to the same exact standard. Although ratings are comparable across markets to an extent, the numerical scores provided by MGI 360 are the most applicable within a given market. The overall score is comprised of five equally weighted major categories that account for up to 20 points in the following areas:\n\nProduct \u2013 Product Breadth and Depth / Implementation/Support \u2022 Management \u2013 Management Team / Board of Directors / Overall Company Talent \u2022 Strategy \u2013 Strategy and Marketing \u2022 Channel \u2013 Sales and Distribution Channels \u2022 Finance \u2013 Financial Health\n\nA company with a high score in each category will be a firm whose products are positioned to dominate their sector, whose management has the relevant experience and track record for success, whose strategy is scalable and realistic, that has the sales channels with the right focus and size to generate success in the marketplace, and which is sufficiently healthy financially to support its customers, invest into products, and withstand eco- nomic adversity.\n\n52\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinions furnished on an as-is basis.

For example, users making a tactical purchase may be less concerned with the Finance score and more interested in comparing Product scores. Conversely, for a strategic purchase in which considerable internal resources will be dedicated, users may place more emphasis on the financial viability and management team with the understanding that the user will be working collaboratively with the supplier to craft a unique solution, thereby rendering the current product rating less meaningful to the decision criteria.\n\nThe ratings process is highly structured and curated by MGI Research senior analysts. The MGI 360 Rating team typically interviews supplier company management and, in some cases, reaches board members and/or key investors as part of the process. During these interviews, MGI analysts follow a highly structured set of standard questions, with the answers then translated into specific scores in each evaluation area. The ratings team also inter- views customers and partners and solicits input from a variety of industry sources not provided by the supplier. The MGI 360 Ratings teams are com- prised of analysts with a high level of experience in technology business and typically with a prior track record of at least 20+ years as an IT practitioner, industry analyst, or an IT executive.\n\nThe 360 Ratings process is continuous, and we update the results on an ongoing basis as new information about a supplier company becomes available. A company that operates in several markets is likely to have individual ratings for each market covered by MGI Research. Companies can have multiple scores \u2013 one for each market, as well as a history of scores.\n\nMGI 360 Ratings help organizations make more informed purchasing and strategy decisions for new and existing technology suppliers, minimize risks, save money, and save time. MGI 360 provides concrete scores that clearly demonstrate differences among suppliers.\n\nMGI 360 rating system is comprehensive but is not meant to be a predictor of company solvency, liquidity, absence of accounting fraud, or stock performance. It is not under any circumstances a recommendation or an offering to buy any securities of any supplier reviewed, nor is it an endorse- ment. Rating research includes but is not limited to interviews with company executives, customers, investors, partners, competitors, product demos, site visits, etc. All MGI 360 Ratings undergo highly critical internal peer reviews.\n\n53\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinion furnished on an as-is basis.

MGI MarketLens\u2122 charts plot suppliers using a pair of key coordinates to shed light on the variations among solutions in each market. They help prospective buyers, investors, and partners see where products align relative to core requirements.

For example, a CPQ administrator may decide to introduce a new product bundle but only make it available to existing customers in North America within a short period of time. Agility is key to ensuring the complexity of setup, maintenance, and change management do not overwhelm sales operations teams and defeat the original goals of gaining efficiency, accuracy, and efficacy. User Experience (UX) is a key element of CPQ Agility. CPQ Agility is also measured by the ability to effect most changes through configuration steps undertaken by sales, finance, and business professionals, rather than relying on outside contractors or expensive corporate IT resources. Lack of agility results in long product launch and change management cycles, increase in quoting error rate, and lower sales productivity. CPQ Agility is meas- ured by analyzing the answers to questions such as:\n\nHow fast are changes in business practices reflected within the CPQ system? \u2022 \u2022 How does the CPQ system handle change? \u2022 \u2022 Does the CPQ system integrate with billing, contract and order management systems, PLM solutions, and revenue recognition, or does it neces- sitate manual loading and processing of batch data?\n\nIs the CPQ system capable of incorporating handling of new types of business and pricing models without reliance on IT resources?\n\nCOMPLEXITY: MGI assigns a relative score of CPQ Complexity on a scale of 0 to 100 based on the most likely (not necessarily the most complex) use case a supplier can tackle with ease. The CPQ Complexity measurement is synthesized based on numerous factors including, but not limited to, the following requirements:\n\n55\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinion furnished on an as-is basis.

The vast majority of CPQ Implementations today still have a relatively modest set of volume requirements (< a few thousand quotes per month and <100 lines per quote). But a significant and growing number of use cases require CPQ systems to handle numerous quotes with complex calculation rules, data integration, and support upwards of several thousand line items per quote.\n\nMGI classifies CPQ Volume in terms of four major categories of quote and transaction volume:\n\nHyperScale: >1 million quotes (or quote line items) per month \u2013 this is the domain of very few organizations with large sales organizations and\n\nchannel networks, and/or companies with highly complex product and quote structures\n\nEnterprise: 100K \u2013 1 million quotes (or quote line items) per month \u2022 MidMarket: 1K \u2013 100K quotes (or quote line items) per month \u2022 SmallBiz: <1K quotes (or quote line items) per month\n\nThe SmallBiz Segment represents CPQ solutions aimed specifically at the needs of small, usually rapidly-growing organizations that emphasize low initial investment, a pay-as-you-go pricing model to support scaling, rapid deployment, and maintenance agility without having to rely on expensive IT resources, either internally or through systems integrators.\n\n57\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinion furnished on an as-is basis.

Contracts. Behind every sale, hire, partnership, grant, and product launch is a contract quietly powering the most important relationships and governing decisions in an organization. On any given day, at least one in three employees touches contract data. From financial data to intellectual property to human capital management, contracts involve an organization\u2019s most sensitive relationships and data. Managing contracts\u2019 creation, execution, evolution and data is essential to a business\u2019s success. Yet for many companies, the systems managing contracts are outdated, fragmented, siloed, buried in an email, or invisible. However, Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) software is no longer a departmental productivity tool \u2014 it\u2019s becoming a strategic engine for growth, agility, and competitive advantage.\n\nRatings Takeaways\n\n\n\nIcertis achieved the highest MGI 360 Rating\u2122 in CLM, while Conga and Agiloft took second and third place, respectively\n\n\n\nSirion and Malbek have improved meaningfully.

AI is helping catalyze this perspective. Gen AI is also going to impact buyers and vendors in ways that are not entirely predictable. Many Gen AI capabilities are becoming commodities, reducing the differentiation among vendors. CLM vendors in weak financial position will be unable to bring to market next-gen AI functionality and struggle to remain independent. Data segregation, governance, management of AI agents and issues related to privacy, pricing, and transparency deserve close user attention.\n\nCLM is no longer just a nice-to-have but a must-have \u2013 a clear strategic imperative with increasingly better-defined budgets, ownership and lines of responsibility. The CLM market is shifting from a period of first-time adopters to organizations adopting more sophisticated solutions that tackle multiple use cases - legal, procurement, sales, human capital management (HCM), finance and others. The initial strategy of adopting CLM to improve legal productivity and shorten contract cycles is giving way to a more comprehensive and nuanced approach that gives equal, if not greater, focus to capturing critical contract data and exposing it to the rest of the organization. CLM is growing into a core enterprise system of record and companies of all sizes seek to align their operational performance with their legal obligations, entitlements, and regulatory mandates.\n\nCLM Market Findings\n\nCLM\u2019s near-term utility and long-term strategic value are gaining wider recognition, as it evolves from a departmental productivity tool into an enterprise-wide system of record\n\n\n\nThe CLM market continues to grow rapidly (>16% annually) while remaining highly fragmented\n\n\n\nThe impact of Gen AI on CLM is accelerating, with strong potential to commoditize many previously advanced capabilities. This will ultimately disrupt the supplier landscape and increase vendor risk while also driving down pricing for low-end CLM use cases\n\nCLM suppliers\u2019 marketing teams continue to struggle with articulating unique and sustainable product differentiation\n\nCLM buyers are continuously challenged in evaluating their CLM options. Nearly 40% of all first-time CLM buyers replace their original selections within 36 months\n\n1\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinions furnished on an as-is basis.

Historically, CLM was positioned as a productivity tool for legal document automation and equated with e- signature and basic repository tools. The interplay between contract data, purchasing, sales, and other enterprise use cases was poorly understood, and organizations were unable to unlock the true value of the data contained within contracts.\n\n(CLM)\n\nKey Issues for CLM\n\nWhat drives the business case for CLM? \u2022 What are the emerging CLM requirements?\n\nWhere will disruption come from? \u2022 How will market segmentation evolve? \u2022 What will leadership amongst software suppliers look like in 2030?\n\nToday the adoption of CLM technology is accelerating as use cases are broadening rapidly beyond legal or procurement management. Several key factors fueled this acceleration in CLM investment and adoption. The multi-year shift to the cloud opened up cost-effective access to CLM capabilities for small and mid-sized companies. The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically forced global adoption of e-signature technologies and catalyzed the push to digitally transform corporate processes. Contract Intelligence is now becoming a priority item as companies grapple with global supply chain disruptions and look for help from AI-based technology to get in front of critical situations. Companies seeking to gain a strategic selling advantage have realized CLM can accelerate sales cycles, improve sales productivity, and increase the efficacy of existing CRM and procurement systems.\n\nHow is the relationship between CLM and core business processes like Procure-to- Pay and Quote-to-Cash evolving?\n\nWhat are the strategic priorities for CLM in terms of investment budgets, human capital, partnerships, and business strategy?\n\nWhat are the best practices for evaluating, adopting, and implementing CLM?\n\nWhat are the costs of evaluating, implementing, and operating a CLM solution?\n\nA properly calibrated investment in CLM software generates enormous long-term benefits on a scale comparable to what automating financials and core order management (ERP) has done over the last thirty years. In organizations with thousands of customers, employees, and suppliers working around the world, inefficient handling of contracts translates into huge overhead expenses, large enough that its optimization can positively impact operating results and earnings per share. Besides the economic productivity factors, lack of an automated system to manage contracts creates significant friction with customers, suppliers, partners, employees, and regulators, all leading to meaningful delays. Not knowing what relationship is covered by which contract, key terms, or contract intent can translate into lost time, diminished productivity, damaged relationships, unnecessary expenses, lost revenue, and reputational damage. In field practice, we have seen companies unable to either acquire or be acquired due to lack of contract automation. When buyers, sellers, and investors are unable to assess the full impact of all existing contracts, clauses, obligations, and entitlements, deals often do not close.\n\nWe believe CLM should be viewed as equally important to an ERP. While ERPs are the core system of record for financial and operating data, CLM is the system of record for all the organization\u2019s relationships, obligations (operating, fi",

Moreover, CLM is evolving rapidly from a static document catalog into a dynamic transactional system that can tightly integrate with other key enterprise transactional components such as CRM, Procurement, CPQ, Billing, and Revenue Recognition. While the early focus of CLM solutions centered around legal and procurement, today\u2019s progressive organizations are seeing CLM\u2019s role as more holistic with critical impact across supply chain, procurement, purchasing, sales, support, field service, billing, revenue recognition, order management, HR, finance, compliance, legal, R&D, and other areas. Today\u2019s CLM investment is increasingly driven by the desire to transition from a tactical departmental productivity focus to data- oriented, enterprise-wide approaches to capture and digitize critical contract information and make it available in a comprehensive, strategic manner. Buyers are increasingly looking for CLM software suppliers to help them realize not just near-term productivity improvement goals but also achieve the long-term promise of CLM as an enterprise system of record.\n\n5\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinion furnished on an as-is basis.

Companies lacking a robust CLM capability are likely to lose their competitive edge in a broad range of areas from procurement and regulatory compliance to sales efficiency, pricing, M&A, and human capital management. The recent sharp shifts in the global tariff regime serve as a powerful example of the importance of a CLM to help organizations deal with rapid business change.\n\nHowever, the journey to enterprise-wide use of CLM data is becoming more complex. Countless companies selected their first CLM solution based on a pain point only to realize a different kind of solution was needed within 24-36 months. The process of assessing CLM requirements, building a business case, selecting and evaluating potential software suppliers and systems integrators, and managing implementation and roll-out requires both market knowledge and traditional process discipline. The market for CLM software is fragmented and noisy, clear differentiation of solutions is lacking. CLM solutions for small companies look and sound like solutions for large companies, creating confusion among buyers. CLM systems that excel at supporting a buy-side use case often fall short in sales ops and vice-versa. CLM implementations are complex and can take longer than planned \u2013 due to poor vendor choice and ill-prepared buyers. First-time buyers of CLM software are excited just to have a contract repository at the end of the implementation cycle and often lack time and resources to implement more complex capabilities. As AI-based functionality becomes mainstream, buyers confusion is increasing. Most evaluation teams lack the training, resources, or experience to adequately and objectively assess vendor claims.\n\nThere are hundreds of CLM software suppliers, some with significant amounts of funding and only a few with all-star management teams.

Generative AI is at a seminal pivot point in CLM and has several important impact areas - some creating opportunities and others posing new challenges. The disruption created by Gen AI will, in our view, lead to a number of binary outcomes affecting user and supplier strategies for CLM.\n\nOutsized Impact of Gen AI Innovation in CLM: Even prior to the mainstream introduction of GenAI (the \"ChatGPT moment\") in 2022, CLM was one of the few areas in business software where the application of AI technologies was well accepted with numerous proof points involving the use of machine learning for contract intelligence, clause extraction and analysis, and identification of contract obligations and entitlements. Yet, the pace of adoption for these advanced features was extremely slow. This is changing. Since CLM Is predominantly a text-oriented software discipline, CLM suppliers and buyers can potentially benefit disproportionately from Gen AI. Gen AI has the potential to dramatically accelerate the speed of development of complex contract management capabilities such as those described by Stages 5-6 of MGI\u2019s CLM Maturity Model (please see the MGI Research Six Stage Maturity Model on pg. 13). Gen AI can bolster user confidence and will accelerate the rate of adoption of some complex CLM features ( e.g., clause and library management, contract intelligence, obligations and entitlements extraction, and data extraction and integration). These are all the types of tasks that Gen AI Is particularly well-suited to. Many CLM capabilities that used to be highly advanced and rare are fast",

This change can be welcome news for many CLM buyers and users but could also lead to serious CLM vendor disruption and eventually drive market consolidation.

New Gen AI-native entrants to CLM will challenge established players across a spectrum of use cases. Some of the established CLM players will not have the resources and R&D budget to take advantage of this market pivot point and will fall behind. In this context, users need to focus on CLM suppliers with stable operating models that are at/near profitability with steady growth and high-quality balance sheets.\n\nContract Data Segregation (CDS): Gen AI carries a theoretical promise to optimize software performance for every customer based on their data. This means that LLMs employed by CLM suppliers need access to their customers\u2019 data to be trained and optimized on that data. Most CLM buyers, however, do not want a general purpose CLM model to be trained on their proprietary data. This creates a dilemma for CLM suppliers. On one hand, vendors want to deliver better capabilities. On the other, they do not want to see their customers be concerned about sensitive corporate data being absorbed to improve a general purpose CLM model and inadvertently shared with direct competitors. Many companies treat their customer and supplier contracts as trade secrets and do not want to see intellectual property leakage. Some CLM suppliers have decided to create separate data tenants for each client. Some vendors with a very large base of clients (10,000+) are wary of offering this as an option, as it creates significant operational overhead and cost. Other business software disciplines where LLMs are being deployed face the same issue. This is an area of continued active research by the suppliers and something CLM buyers need to be aware of and actively discuss with vendors. CLM buyers should seek an unambiguous statement from potential software providers on how they plan to address contract data segregation in an LLM context.\n\nPricing and Packaging of Gen AI CLM Capabilities: Many potential buyers of CLM products see Gen AI capabilities as features they expect to get and for which they are often not willing to pay significantly more, if at all. Some suppliers are experimenting with usage-based pricing as a mechanism for price discovery against an operating budget. The consumption pricing approach could be a good near-term approach for vendors and users, but longer-term users want budget predictability and transparency. Early versions of Gen AI capabilities relied on API access to public LLM models priced on a consumption basis. Newer developments are increasingly built around privately hosted LLM models where vendors do not have to deal with per-transaction charges and have more flexibility in pricing their CLM features.

Unlike traditional workflow automation, an AI Agent does not have to always follow a pre-programmed recipe based on a finite number of states, it can adapt to changing conditions and learn while still pursuing its goal. A key area within CLM is dedicated to workflow automation \u2014 the ability to route contract review and approval based on a complex set of conditions. Many CLM suppliers built their marketing strategy around a differentiation in this area. This is defined by Stages 3-4 of MGI\u2019s 6-stage CLM Maturity Model. Many CLM vendors will transition traditional rule-based workflow automation to a system based around AI Agents. But as interesting and appealing as it may sound, Agents also create new challenges. Agents are designed to minimize human intervention, but organizations may want human intervention when it comes to important contracts. While not difficult, what is hard is to develop a full- stack AI Agent governance model where everything done can be tracked, explained, stopped, reversed and documented. No organization in the world will be comfortable with a completely \"black box\" approach to CLM. And this is just the start of the kinds of questions enterprise CLM buyers will have. What happens if an Agent needs to be customized? Where will the data be stored? Can the Agent framework pass cyber-security due diligence? CLM buyers contemplating the adoption of CLM capabilities built around AI Agents need to get transparency on these issues.\n\nData Hygiene: Gen AI has the potential to amplify data errors and generate misguided conclusions, whether the data is stored in structured or unstructured form. Successful adoption of Gen AI capabilities in CLM will be ultimately gated (but not stopped) by the ability of companies to clean up their data.

Organizations with a clear understanding of where their data is, the shape it is in, and a realistic plan to manage it consistently outperform CLM project teams that do not take data hygiene seriously.\n\nCLM Vendor Impact: In our view, the pressure to leverage Gen AI technologies in CLM will prove to be a seminal point in CLM market evolution. Gen AI adoption will require incremental investment in product, marketing, and sales. Funding for later-stage venture-backed companies (Series C and beyond) remains tight and IPO markets are effectively closed to all but exceptional companies. Unprofitable vendors will struggle to play catch-up, as they will be challenged to make adequate investments and lack the resources to acquire next-gen capabilities. CLM suppliers at the late stage of funding will be challenged by this set of market conditions and will have to get creative, perhaps through horizontal consolidation transactions to build critical mass.\n\nCLM Top 35 \u2013 Why These Companies?\n\nThis report focuses on the top 35 vendors in CLM and provides comprehensive MGI 360 Ratings for the top 21. These vendors, based on MGI\u2019s research findings, are among the most important CLM suppliers in the market today and merit the attention of buyers, partners, and investors. The MGI 360 Rating methodology is quantitative in nature and a tough grading scale. However, if a vendor is among the 21 suppliers to receive a complete 360 Rating, by definition, it is among the top in the industry, regardless of the absolute score. The criteria for inclusion include one or more of the following:\n\nMarket visibility: The company has one or more of these characteristics: above-average growth, frequently shortlisted in buyer evaluations, large installed base, and/or MGI clients express interest in the company or mention them in analyst calls. Innovation: The product has unique capabilities and the potential to disrupt the market \u2013 buyers should be aware of this product/company, even if it is not a fit for them today. Solution strength: Breadth and depth of solution, support for various business models and use cases, and the supplier\u2019s ability to help customers implement and gain value from the solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrated success: Most, but not all, vendors covered are able to provide MGI with reference customers and partners to interview. Independent of the provision (or lack thereof) of vendor references, MGI conducts its own interviews and research on customers, partners, and investors.\n\nThere are hundreds of CLM software providers delivering a range of products from broad solutions addressing all enterprise contract management needs to niche add-ons to vertical-specific applications. Some are part of a larger portfolio of business applications or contained within a procurement-oriented application suite. Vendors are not excluded uniquely based on size (e.g., revenue or customer count below any threshold), willingness to participate in the research process, or ability to cover a majority of buy, sell, and enterprise cases.\n\nInclusion in the CLM Top 35 does not represent an endorsement or an outright recommendation to purchase a product. Conversely, exclusion of a supplier from this report is not a recommendation to exempt it from consideration. Organizations should evaluate potential supplier",

The MGI 360 scores reflect analyst opinions based on a scale of 0 to 100, combined with an analyst outlook (Positive, Negative, or Neutral), across five key pillar scores:\n\nPRODUCT: How strong is the product\u2019s competitive position?\n\nFinances\n\nProduct\n\nMANAGEMENT: How competent and experienced is the management team?\n\nCHANNELS: Does the company have the sales capability and channels needed to bring products to market?\n\nStrategy\n\nMgmt Team\n\nSTRATEGY: Does the company have a realistic view of the opportunity and a compelling strategy for success?\n\nFINANCE: Is the company growing and profitable?\n\nChannel\n\nEach of the five equally weighted pillar scores ranges from 0 to 20 points. Each pillar score is subdivided into numerous sub-categories \u2013 in total, over 149 criteria are combined to generate a single MGI 360 rating. We frequently emphasize that the MGI 360 scale is very demanding, and companies need to be exceptional in every aspect of their business in order to command higher scores.

    "content": "oach This Market?\n\nKnow your use cases. The most successful CLM vendor evaluations begin with a clear understanding of use cases, user requirements, examining how process flows can be improved, the condition and priority of integrations, the condition of the data, and opportunities for applying AI. Before evaluating a vendor, it\u2019s important to consider your contract volumes, contract types, CLM user (e.g., legal, procurement, sales, HR), company size, budget, and highest priority items.\n\nIt\u2019s a diverse market with lots of choice. Take time to understand your options and find the right fit. There are solutions for nearly every use case, budget, and organizational size. The ACV MarketLenses in this report provide insight into how solutions compare in terms of their abilities to handle contract and business complexity, volumes, and their respective agility. As the ACV MarketLenses show, there is a clear segmentation of solutions based on these three vectors.\n\nUse the MGI Six Stage CLM Maturity Model to determine what functionality and capabilities are most important and then map suppliers into each stage. All the CLM vendors rated in this report can handle at least stages one and two \u2013 these should be considered commodity table stakes. Only a few suppliers provide support for stages five and six. Contact your MGI account representative with questions or if it\u2019s difficult placing a particular solution.\n\nA single vendor strategy may not be best. Most mid to large size companies will end up supporting multiple CLM solutions \u2013 standardizing on a single vendor is an unlikely aspiration for many buyers. While most buyers and IT departments have the desire to support only one CLM product, a more nuanced strategy may be more effective, particularly as it relates to contract intelligence. Rather than trying to enforce a standard choice, buyers may achieve better business outcomes with higher user adoption by implementing CLM solutions by geography, specific use cases, or by business segment.\n\nMarket upheaval has begun. In twelve short months, multiple CLM vendors have replaced their CEOs and key executives. Of the 21 rated vendors in this report, three suppliers have been acquired (Scrive acquired Contractbook, LegalSifter acquired Contract Logix, and Workday acquired Evisort), and several have new private equity owners. More than one are looking for an exit. Mega vendors could enter this market in a more substantial way. Workday is the first major player to enter CLM but given the TAM and strategic importance of CLM within organizations, more mega vendors will want to get in on the action. AI will likely commoditize segments of this market \u2013 and do it faster than even the CLM vendors expect. Unprofitable vendors and those with weak balance sheets will strain to keep pace with the coming change. Assessing vendor viability and getting comfortable with vendor risk are two buyer imperatives in the CLM market today.\n\nAvoid the mistakes of others. The CLM market has an abundance of choice. Many vendors make similar sales and marketing claims, and first-time buyers are often unready, inadequately prepared to assess vendors. As a result, it\u2019s not uncommon for buyers to discover they have made the wrong choice and go back 2-3 years later searching for a more comprehensive solution. With better preparation and more information, this costly error can be avoided.\n\nMost mega vendors are not innovating \u2013 and will likely have to partner or acquire next-gen capabilities. The largest enterprise applications vendors, with the exception of Workday, are lagging in CLM innovation to the market. SAP, which is still promoting Ariba, has partnered with Icertis to sell into its customer base. Salesforce, via its Revenue Cloud, claims to have basic contract management features, but is not rated by MGI. Oracle has a multitude of contract management solutions in market (e.g., Fusion Contract Management, Sales Contracts, Procurement Contracts, et al) and has partne",

Stage 6 supports automated contract execution that initiates review, provides alerts, and recommends/ensures enforcement action (e.g., penalty clauses, minimum payments).\n\nKey CLM Growth Drivers\n\nMGI Research forecasts the CLM market is rapidly growing with a 5-Year CAGR of 18.3% (2022-2026) compared to the broader enterprise software market's 6-12% range. The growth rate is fueled by several tail winds:\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing Last Has Its Benefits: CLM is the last major enterprise process to undergo digitization. CLM benefits from prior digitization of monetization (quote-to-cash) and supply chain/procurement (procure-to-pay) processes Extremely Compelling ROI: Greenfield CLM projects can generate triple digit ROI. CLM can generate direct revenue and expense management impact that is quantifiable and compelling in the short and long run. Contract friction can translate into slower sales cycles, missed renewals, mispricing and revenue leakage.\n\nMultiple Use Cases, Multiple Buyers: CLM's cross-functional value proposition spans legal, compliance, sales operations, finance, and customer service\u2014creating multiple budget justifications and stakeholder constituencies that don't exist for single-purpose enterprise applications\n\n13\n\nDisclaimer: Information and opinion furnished on an as-is basis.

This transformation is occurring precisely as organizations recognize that traditional manual contract processes represent critical operational bottlenecks.\n\nGenerative AI: Infusion of Gen AI capabilities into a sector already familiar with AI is enabling even modestly sized\n\n\n\nCLM vendors to rapidly add sophisticated contract intelligence features that were previously impossible. Shift from Departmental to Enterprise: CLM adoption continues to shift from early-adopter legal departments to mainstream enterprise initiatives driven by digital transformation imperatives. An increasing number of organizations now have multiple CLM use cases in production.\n\nRegulatory Evolution: The more volatile global regulatory framework (e.g. tariffs, shifting environmental priorities) places additional pressure on companies to automate critical compliance management functions and contract management is at the center of these automation initiatives.\n\nM&A: Merger and Investment activity remain the perennial drivers of CLM Investment. No M&A transaction can complete without a full review of all key target company contracts. Paper contracts are an obstacle and a risk in this context. CLM solutions are a catalyst and an enabler.\n\nEssential Elements of CLM Evaluation\n\nWhen constructing a list of core CLM requirements, organizations need to address the following questions at a minimum:\n\nHow many contracts and contract types does your organization need to manage annually? \u2022 What is the growth in contracts annually? \u2022 Who is involved in defining and maintaining",

In addition, we recommend asking prospective suppliers to demonstrate implementation of several use case scenarios, including edge cases. Talking with references early in the evaluation cycle is a significant contributor to overall sourcing success. Contact MGI Research for an in-depth consultation on how to optimize the evaluation process without sacrificing functional fidelity and costs. The overall focus should always be in implementable and useable functionality",

Their qualifications, economics, and fit with the organization are just as important for the overall success.\n\nLast, but not least, organizations should carefully weigh all available customer support options. Budget permitting, premium or ultra-premium support options tend to generate the best long-term outcomes. At the same time, it is important to establish clear performance and service expectations with the software supplier prior to implementation.\n\nBudget Recommendations\n\nDepending on the use case, annual spend on contract management software can range at the low end from hundreds to several thousand dollars per month (e.g., $200-$2500/month) to hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars for global, high-end CLM deployments. Implementation costs at the low end are nominal, while services fees for mid-size to large size projects will cost 1x-2.5x the annual cost of the software.\n\nThere is no free lunch. Buyers should be wary of CLM vendors that \u201cgive away\u201d or bundle the cost of implementation into the first year of subscription fees. The days of cheap venture capital investment dollars are essentially over. CLM vendors \u2013 especially late-stage venture backed suppliers \u2013 need to have a clear path to profi",

Whether a solution was built natively on AI from the ground up or if AI-based capabilities were layered atop an existing tech stack \u2014 all of these options should be assessed for AI tech genesis (where did this tech come from, how is it maintained, what are the backgrounds of key tech staff), demonstrable proof points of AI platform consistency (same output with the same input), ability to manage contract data privacy and segregation In LLM training, option to provide customer's own LLM and training, transparency on AI model performance testing, and pricing/cost metrics.\n\nFunctional and Technical Requirements: there is often a tendency to let lists of functional and technical requirements balloon in size and complexity. Even with weighting, this leads to a complex decision process and is not proven to generate better outcomes. CLM buyers are best served by starting out with the Use Case/ICP process and then focusing on consumable functionality. In a highly competitive market like CLM, vendors are under pressure to say \u201cyes\u201d to most questions. As such, MGI heavily encourages speaking with 3-5 customer references. MGI Research conducts thousands of reference interviews per year. Often, the AI capabilities touted by the suppliers are not even implemented by their best references - for reasons that have nothing to do with the quality of the feature but more so related to internal issues of time, resources, security, etc. It\u2019s important to verify a vendor\u2019s claims prior to implementation.\n\nContract Lifecycle Management: Top 5 Countries and Verticals\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 CLM Top Spending Countries + Verticals 2022-2026\n\nFig. 2 shows the five countries and industry verticals that are projected to spend the most on CLM software from 2022-2026.

Four core elements frame Agiloft's market position: its no-code architecture, the Data-First Agreement Platform (DAP) aiming to make contract data accessible and actionable across the enterprise, its configurability with a focus on complex workflows, and very high customer retention and customer satisfaction. Feedback is generally positive, with users citing ease of working with Agiloft and its commitment to customer success. Areas for improvement include more seamless partner-led implementations, greater support consistency, and an increased focus on Al-led innovation. In 2024, KKR acquired a majority stake in Agiloft. The transition to KKR ownership has been relatively seamless and provided Agiloft with additional support to make investments across sales, marketing, and product. Financially, the company is growing and profitable. Agiloft also acquired Screens, an Al tool that supports contract review, curation, and versioning. While Agiloft remains a leading CLM provider, the company would benefit from geographic expansion, deeper verticalization, and scaled enterprise go-to-market efforts. Currently, the company is strategically focusing on Al innovation and expanding their partner ecosystem.\n\nIdeal Use Case\n\nMid-to-large size North American and UK enterprises in need of a highly configurable CLM solution with deep capabilitie",

And I think we just need to come back to team and say, like, one of his main takeaways was, like, Why do we exist at the end of the day? Yeah, yeah. Like, that was something he kept honing in, back in on of like, Zora exists because we provide the agility through, like, the continuous change that companies are like facing based on new go to market strategy, AI is throwing a wrench into the works, and it's like Zora has the ability to provide our buyers with the agility to be able to handle continuous change.\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:15 Can I give some more context on the light of the existing?

Question is about, like, really bringing a life like you will kill your company if you make that decision and like that. So it's not, yeah, it's not just agility, but it's like, Look, if you don't put this thing in, if you choose to go the easy route, you die. And here's why, right? So you need to go through the steps of adding this third thing that you didn't doesn't necessarily make sense, yeah, initially, like, what that's the context?\n\nSpeaker 1  2:06 The thing that I liked was like, you're choosing law. You're choosing Laura, because you should value long term adaptability, ability versus short term convenience. And many folks are taking the short term, convenient route of like the Salesforce plugin SAP, like that was one of his examples. And it's like, you need Zora because we provide that long term adaptability versus like,\n\nSpeaker 2  2:33 all the time horizon is, I've got a self serve motion, and I'm not thinking about when I'll be sales assisted. How do I move along that spectrum?\n\nSpeaker 4  2:44 Yeah, like, the you're always going to change. Yes, you could, no matter, you could hire Accenture to come in and connect your Salesforce thing to Oracle thing, and it would work great for the next 90 days. And then after that, like, it's going to start to break, it's going to start to break. And then two years from now, you're screwed.\n\nSpeaker 2  2:59 And also, when you know, you what you want to what I've come to realise is that we, I was breaking down the our markets into plg and SLG, but they're too rigid that it's there's a spectrum. And you our sales teams can live anywhere along that spectrum. Our customers can live along that spectrum between sales assisted and self serve, self self service, sales assisted.

It's just a spectrum. Was that your fourth thing? Vendor for life?\n\nSpeaker 3  4:51 I will also say, like, there's a there's a standard industry terminology.

Guess like I know the product point of view is going to be how you all just reorganised, like, acquisition, order, order to cash or pick the pick the right language, like that, the business process view, yeah, Andrew, what's, what's your view of, like, a frame? Are you in the camp of, like, it's one platform, or it's like, how would you\n\nSpeaker 5  7:01 we've been testing out just with talking to some customers about that. I don't know if you've seen the layer cakes, yeah, they've been waiting around, testing that out as a framework for talking about it. So for example, we're at nine Fairfax last week, who is media, but they're trying to consolidate everything, and they have both B to B and B to C plays, and we use that as a way of structuring the conversation always, or fits. What that was really good at doing was knowing that we're up against stripe and piano, for example. For these guys, it really highlighted that we can merge the world of B to B and B to C together, which was important to them. We know that's not stripe streams, channel and also for them, they were already thinking down to the cash level. They weren't thinking revenue. So we were able to bring that into a further conversation, into taking right one step further, because that's a something that we're very good at as well.\n\nSpeaker 4  7:58 But your frame, your frame start, that your layer, click thing is built on A, B to B versus B to C frame.\n\nSpeaker 5  8:05 It's a, it's a. We do both of them. It's like there's two different ways of acquiring one's a more a product, leg growth style, and one's more of your traditional quote, CPQ style. Or there's a combination of both.\n\nSpeaker 2  8:19 Isn't that just sales self serve, or sales assisted, right? Yeah, right. Because I think, I think the if you talk about self serve, then you can cherry pick the B to C that you take self serve to, whereas, if we say B to C, B to B, pl, G, B to B, SLG, they're quite rigid, and it misses the nuance in the middle, right?

And like, we have solutions for supporting your challenges around acquisition order, then we have a set of solutions to your challenges around order to cash. And it's like, doesn't mean we have to change this top line narrative that, like Zora has it all for you, but we have a specific set of products and can focus the conversation based on, like, what your current needs are, and that's where we could say we're talking about acquisition to order right now. This means feature 123, like, Why? Why does, why does teen feel like we need to separate it into we have a completely different B to C story.\n\nSpeaker 3  10:17 I had the same question. Because, to me, we have acquisition to cash. We have multiple entry points along that journey where you can enter the whole thing, you can enter one place and expand all this different stuff. Yeah, and it is channel agnostic,\n\nSpeaker 4  10:32 but you just looking for a frame because you said, like, we do everything for everybody. You can't. It's not good,\n\nUnknown Speaker  10:39 right? No, I know that.\n\nSpeaker 4  10:40 That's like, we're too configurable, right? So you need some framework to help people understand, okay, like, what does or do? That's why I think the layer cake thing is resonating, because it's like, hey, we can do all this, but it gives people a way to digest the information, right?\n\nSpeaker 3  10:54 I just have a conflicting view, because I actually don't think the problem is narrowing in, like the product or process view of what we do. I think our problem is narrowing in which pain point in ICP are we best suited at targeting? And that's a product question, a marketing question, well, a sales question,\n\nSpeaker 4  11:17 no, because look where the strategy conversation has gone is that we're there's really two things, right? One is, we're gonna have an intentional push into SaaS companies, and we're specifically going to be focusing on the finance persona at SaaS companies. So that's an ICP and pain point question. So that's an ICP pain point, okay? The next one is, we're generally going to serve complex enterprises as they come in bound for which I have\n\nSpeaker 3  11:41 the same problem with that as I have a battleground to it's such a generic\n\nSpeaker 4  11:46 but that's that's a that ends up being who we're selling to.\n\nSpeaker 3  11:50 So but this is where we get into a problem, though, because complex si engagements, if they bring me a telecom deal, my product roadmap is dramatically and Jonathan's is too dramatically different than if they bring me a fence serve, than if they bring me a media company like, and I don't mean like slightly different road",

They weren't like media, they weren't SAS. They were like other, yeah, but they were still judged to be companies that are a good fit for\n\nUnknown Speaker  12:42 our platform, where they si pipeline\n\nSpeaker 4  12:44 size influence, like 80% of the source did or influence it. So, so,\n\nSpeaker 3  12:51 yeah, it only takes one Twilio. So I agree that, like that eight, there's something in that eight that's that's meaningful, right? But it only takes one Twilio. I can't serve those eight because I'm servicing that one?\n\nSpeaker 4  13:00 Yeah, totally. So there's this whole conversation that says, Look, we have to be really good about, like, not letting the one Twilio come in and blow everything up. But, like, we ought to be able to, there's enough. There's enough. This is the we do all this stuff, right? You're saying yourself, we do all this stuff. There's a lot of companies that fit in the spot of this. I think that's the realisation from the strategy exercises. Like, we're not just going to pick just going to pick telco, we're not going to pick, meaning, I think a vertical, we're not going to pick a vertical because, like, you're all saying, like, we do this with everybody, so\n\nSpeaker 2  13:30 sales teams will pick the vertical, right? So I spoke to, I've done a lot of kind of talking to people like Paulo and Mark gagne and DJ and Boone. Paulo made the point to me that 60% of his business is not complex B to B, it's other it's B to B, it's plg, it's B to C, correct. It's not B to B, complex. So he wants so, but he also has complex. Boone wants complex. DJ wants plg. SLG wants to go up and down the slider at will. Mark gagne, brute forced B to any by doing deals with, with, yes. So we do all of that, so that, so that, so that, I guess the two maybe something we're going to talk about. The two lenses are slightly different, commerce, commerce Foundation, acquisition to order is a different problem set to what to your problem set, which is fundamental, where we join is probably payments, right? It's like, that's the little bit in the middle, and maybe some of the interactions between the experiences and the back end, but largely my problems and are I don't I think I can solve for the spectrum. Yeah, I don't think I have the same problem as you do. I solve for the spectrum because I what we want is omni channel. Omni channel is sales assisted to self serve. Don't have to say P to C, B to B, pl, G, complex. It's just, where are you on the spectrum? And the thing I'm doing is creating, finally, the commerce Foundation, by ripping it out of the product ",

Know that we're going we're going to do B to B fast outbounding 10 times better, and we're going to be better at serving all the other customers when they are inbounded to us like that, seems to me like the most discernible changes the inbound outbound balance.\n\nSpeaker 4  16:02 Yeah, that's, that's, that's a, that's a pipeline strategy, right?

And Zora goes, we got that problem because we do everything. It is less compelling than a vendor who comes to me and says, I do that problem.\n\nSpeaker 4  16:27 Really, I'm saying the same thing as you. Man, that's why I'm trying to say, like, we need a framework that allows us to chunk up our everything into pieces so that it drives relevance, right? And you, the way you chunk up your story, just needs to be a framework. Like, we have this, we have this massive, complex platform. What's the logical way to break it up that helps our fields? Grok, like, I'm going to put this piece with this customer that helps the marketing team go Got it? Like, I'm a position this piece in this way.\n\nSpeaker 3  16:55 I think you called the first 1b to B SAS. Is it B to B SAS, or is it early stage SAS?\n\nSpeaker 4  17:00 It's just, it's just SaaS, not early stage.\n\nSpeaker 3  17:02 So here's so I'm going to index on this one, because I still have an issue with the generic size side of things. I actually think that that's a good framework to, like, lock in this until I figure out, like, if we say that's our ICP and we can do everything, like, how do we reframe the story around everything that we can do for that ICP. The problem, though, comes back to like, if we want to focus on SaaS, some SaaS customers are going to sell their product at $50,000 a pop, in which case there are things like E payments that just doesn't matter in our portfolio. And then there's customers who are selling widgets at $10 a month, and then, in which case, I have to have my E payments. So this ",

May\n\nSpeaker 5  18:46 I just chuck something in here? So one of the big things I've seen a shift that I've been trying to get CSEs across the company to do, is essentially, when they talk to a customer is following the money, right? So it's like, start at acquisition. I don't care what they're selling or what they're doing, somehow they're they're acquiring, right? Take, follow the money through the process and take them all the way to the end. So yeah, funnel, yeah. I think the story, the overall story, needs to be getting people think about the funnel, because I see it so often where everyone just starts with billing, right? They go into a talk to a customer about billing, and then they start satelliteing out to go, Oh, we've also got some revenue. We've also can do some acquisition stuff. And I think the fundamental shift from an aese point of view has got to be, get them thinking that way. The first discovery question should be, how do you sell the customers start from there, yeah, all the different semantics of the different types of acquisition and different types of business model should run that because they should have the be smart enough to say, Okay, no, this customer, they sell this way, therefore we should follow this path.\n\nSpeaker 2  19:52 Yeah, but that lines up with omni channel. That's the that's the elusive bit. And omni channel hasn't been delivered because the found commerce Foundation, which is the intersection between the things that deliver omni channel, the components have lived all over the acquisition to order space. So bring, what we're going to do is bring those all together in a single layer, the proper, the what commerce foundation, I think, was always meant to be, deliver omni channel. And omni channel is sales assisted and self service. So I think Andrew is right, is that the if yo",

We know billing, in its infinite complexity, can take care of any sales motion, whether you're doing B to B, plg complex, SARS B to C in car systems, whether, whether you know that one of the stories is like, I start off as a guided selling experience, and then I have to click Hey. I need to speak to a sales rep. In order for that to happen, context has to be shared between single systems so that sales rep can pick up the same view as the as the guided selling experience that's delivered through experiences context is universal, orchestration and actions is universal. That's omni channel. So I think what, I guess, what, what we're saying is acquisition to order is true. Omni channel, the billing system, which is order to cash, can cater for any channel, any type of selling experience, because you have the configurability. The only thing that we're missing, and I kind of it's a bit like a unicorn, is, I've heard about this elusive thing called reference architecture, reference implementation, seed billing. The only thing that the only blocker, is that full, fully baked billing is too big a thing for the B to B, plg SaaS businesses to consume. So that's something I wanted to talk to you about this afternoon. Is, how do you I spoke to Clarissa. They reckon they could get billing up for a B to B plg company in four weeks, but they don't have the reference architecture, the reference implementation. So that's the only blocker, but I think it's, how do we sell? To Andrew's point, and then billing is the engine that it doesn't matter how you sell.\n\nSpeaker 4  22:07 So, so is it like you're saying it's really there's this, and then there's\n\nUnknown Speaker  22:12\n\ntwo A and 2b\n\nSpeaker 4  22:18 That's another frame, yeah, which is like, let me tell you the acquisition to order story, which is omni channel. And now let me tell you how that order turns into cash for a self service business. And let me tell you how that turns into cash for more like, A, B to B, yeah. So that that's, that's one way you\n\nSpeaker 7  22:35 could do it. I think so. Or you\n\nSpeaker 3  22:40 it's really only the payments and AR piece though, that is drastically different,\n\nUnknown Speaker  22:44\n\nright? Or\n\nSpeaker 3  22:46 two motions, yes, self service, it's E payments, so assisted, its accounts receivable.\n\nUnknown Speaker  22:52 Option two, is this where you go? Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2  22:57 Is it? Well, it, sorry, is it the is it the, is it the complexity of the like rev rec, for example, that is also\n\nSpeaker 3  23:06 not really, no, no. The complexity is making sure that the billing to rev REC is all integrated, which is a technical thing that we're working on.\n\nUnknown Speaker  23:18 Okay, so let me show you the three options\n\nUnknown Speaker  23:21 you guys are gonna vote.\n\nSpeaker 4  23:24 Here's option one. We do everything. We're going to show you one demo, and it's going to hit on everything we do, yeah? Somehow, like, end to end. That doesn't get my vote. This is what t",

Just to orient you, we're going to show you, like an end to end, acquisition to cash for a self service type company, and we'll show you an end to end acquisition to cash for like a more complex assisted sale company, acknowledging that there'll be companies that sit in the middle, but let's just show you the two ends of the extreme, just to get your head around it. That's option two.\n\nUnknown Speaker  24:20 Here's option three. Is this other one,\n\nUnknown Speaker  24:27 this one, which is something about, look the\n\nUnknown Speaker  24:35 there's something about, like, Omni channel commerce\n\nSpeaker 2  24:38 up front, so I hear what you're saying. And then,\n\nSpeaker 4  24:41 and then, like, let us. Let us show you what the world looks like for a company where this has to be automated because it's at scale and it's electronic payments and blah, blah. And then let me show you one where it's like an assistant sale.\n\nSpeaker 3  24:51 Let's just talk to this guy. I think I'm, I think I'm leaning towards this one. Yeah, me too. But my the two a and the 2b in the order to cash. World is different. On the x axis, so like in just purely self service versus Assist is not delineated enough, because self service to a for a consumption based business, super complex, totally different billing implementation, but the payments and the revenue is all the same. Versus a pure subscription place self service, the billing is different, but the payments and revenues\n\nSpeaker 4  25:29 or just pick, pick two scenarios that are like opposite ends of the spectrum, acknowledging there's always going to be companies that have something in the\n\nSpeaker 3  25:36 middle, right? But that's what I mean, yeah, in the billing space, those two spectrums are subscription and consumption. I don't care if it's self service assisted or not on the front end. What I care about is your How are you calculating how much you owe me? Which is a consumption based calculation or a subscription\n\nSpeaker 2  25:57 flat? So it's not delineated by self service.\n\nSpeaker 3  26:01 You know, the billing complexity is delineated by, you're saying it was like product complexity.\n\nSpeaker 4  26:05 There's like, another layer in here, which is, like the billing piece.\n\nSpeaker 3  26:10 Yeah, you're the billing is the nexus of all of this. It can ingest the multi upfront, yeah, and then it needs to figure it out and, like, implement for whatever your business is, and then disperse it out to the back\n\nUnknown Speaker  26:21 end, right? But the flows, I mean, right.\n\nSpeaker 4  26:25 But you would still, you'd pick a flow that says, hey, we want to show you an omni channel acquisition\n\nSpeaker 3  26:30 thing, because, to Jonathan's point, ",

Can I\n\nUnknown Speaker  27:11 You gotta stop sharing before?\n\nSpeaker 6  27:16 Before you share it. That will at least help ground me. So we started with like, what is team getting on stage and saying? And Chris, you started to say, agility through continuous change. You're choosing Zora because you need long term adaptability versus short term convenience. We talked about this like moving along the spectrum. If we had to say whether it's one story or two stories, Zora is for companies that X, Y, Z do we all have one answer to that question, like whether we have one two stories. We're not everything to everybody. There are companies we're not for.\n\nSpeaker 4  27:52 Hold back Tara, we're just gonna take us in another direction. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 6  27:59 My only thought is that, to me, like, until we have the centre of gravity, we're like, trying to get around the centre of gravity by figuring out, like, its parts. But like, to me, if I know, like we are for companies that x,\n\nSpeaker 4  28:13 but you got to go. You got to go. You got to start with the parts. You can't start with the tagline and work your way down from that. You got to like the tagline as a result of like the product strategy.\n\nSpeaker 6  28:25 Oh yeah, no, I don't, I don't mean like the tagline. I mean just like, like, what companies are we not for?\n\nSpeaker 4  28:33 We're kind of saying, well, like, if you have simple, if you just started, like, simplistic monetization, you don't need us. Just hook Salesforce up to Oracle, and you're done simplistic meaning like, Look, I just so I sell widgets.\n\nSpeaker 3  28:46 But there's a problem with that story, because that becomes the unicorn that grows into a more complex billing, and then we've missed out on the early stage, and we're trying to capture them as they grow, instead of growing.\n\nSpeaker 4  28:59 We explicitly have said we are not, we have not, we don't have a strategy next year to go after low end SaaS companies.\n\nSpeaker 2  29:06 What's low end in ICP, like,\n\nUnknown Speaker  29:11 companies with, like, less than 50 million,\n\nUnknown Speaker  29:14 you know, Y Combinator companies?\n\nSpeaker 8  29:18 Are we for any company with, like, a recurring revenue model, like, is that what we it's that who we're I'm hearing, no,\n\nSpeaker 4  29:25 we are not explicitly going after and trying to compete for, like, Y Combinator companies.\n\nSpeaker 3  29:30 We're trying to catch ",

You're going to use so, like, Look, if you still want to use us, we'll talk to you. But like, look, it's going to cost you 100 grand. The reason you want to buy us is because, like, you know you're thinking about rev rack and shipping. If you're a Y Combinator engineer, you're not thinking about, right? Like, so, like, we're not focused on trying to sell those companies. Yeah, we're not trying to focus. We're not trying to sell to product companies.\n\nUnknown Speaker  30:41 Like, meaning, I sell widgets. Yeah, that's all I do. I think\n\nSpeaker 3  30:46 this is clarifying, writing, these are the things, documenting these and getting aligned. These will help us\n\nUnknown Speaker  30:52 shape the story we're trying to sell the professional services companies,\n\nSpeaker 4  30:57 right where you're like, 80% of the revenue service is based because we don't do like, time, materials like that.\n\nSpeaker 3  31:01 We want to have some services billing capabilities when you're using services as part of your product station, right? But we're\n\nUnknown Speaker  31:07 not, we're not a professional service ability.\n\nSpeaker 2  31:09 So you have to so that the ICP, that the revenue is not a big deal. But you have to have a CFO,\n\nSpeaker 4  31:15 yeah, you a relatively mature finance organisation, but you could be a $50 million SAS company. Have that yet. So, yeah, I would say that, like, we don't have a lot of success in, like, super large existing companies, where it's just a little like bolt on thing in the side, you know, where it's like an unproven startup within these large enterprises, because it ended up being like, a lot of calories to sell. And oftentimes that turns, they turn anyway, right? So what else we don't want to Pete doesn't want to build a lot of industry specific functionality. So like, the media space, like, we don't want to get into like, add, you know, content.

So what I was thinking is a scenario where, let's say there's a company that's selling AI assistance, and there's a person who works at a bank, a senior person who goes in and essentially subscribes to it. Just try it out herself, like she gets one seat for herself, and she goes through a product lead, sales, self service. She then loves her, and then she goes and either does a call sales or a sales rep will see that she's somebody worth contacting. And then they go in, and she buys 5000 seats through a CPQ process for the bank she works at, and then we have a consumption, usage type scenario. So we've gone from a individual subscriber, but then that's grown into a more complex sales assist type scenario, and then we can go through all the rest of the steps. But I was just trying to work out, because at that time, I was thinking, how do we address that plg motion as well as A, B to B, more traditional motion. And this is almost like the you could for somebody where plg is not even relevant. Skip the first scene, and then you're just following the normal flow from scene two onwards.\n\nUnknown Speaker  36:18 And that's that is omni\n\nSpeaker 3  36:20 channel and yes and Andrew, just a quick feedback and request, please don't reference collections and Cash App. It's payments and accounts receivable Cash App and collections are features within accounts receivable. We have got to start getting the sales team to shift away from this feature based collections Cash App.\n\nUnknown Speaker  36:39 Have we made that shift yet? Though? I mean, I\n\nUnknown Speaker  36:42 agree we made the shift. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3  36:47 Scene wants us to share, no. Market wants to shift. Wants us to shift totally like they give me the language. What was it? Again? It's payments and accounts receivable.\n\nSpeaker 8  36:57 We have made a shift in terms of any enablement that's so that can be we should talk about what the AR session at sko is, because there's still an opportunity to lean heavily into our existing customer base and sell them collections.\n\nSpeaker 3  37:12 Yeah, Cash App, Oh, you think you have AR collections? You do have ao, yeah. Did you know we have this new Cash App feature? Yeah?\n\nSpeaker 8  37:18 Well, we have advanced collections now, which is going to be much more, which is going to do all things that's awesome.\n\nSpeaker 4  37:23 You're saying, like, I agree with you, just in terms of Tommy and language, like, you two need to be on the same like, timeline. Yeah, yeah, Emil, you care about\n\nSpeaker 5  37:41 candy. About if you followed your option to their Carl, where you've got the two motions from a on stage demo perspective, you're going to get very repeated, yeah, because the acquisition bits different, and then the payments and AR bit's different depending on if you have one or the other.

For sko Our recommendation is for the breakouts to allow reps to go through the different types of story structures for different types of customers. So be is it like if we did the core story on the main stage? Reps are going to be invited to come and see how that plays out for media company, or for a B to any or for like, for B to B SAS as part of the breakout experience based on your portfolio, choose your own adventure based on your portfolio. We're going to make everyone learn the core story, like our thinking, and we're getting ahead of ourselves a little bit. Our thinking was like, there's, there's a core story that it's delivered on the main stage that you come and you relearn and you practice as part of a breakout. Then there's a next breakout, which is to choose your own adventure, which is, how do you adapt that core story? And that core story is really for our B to B SAS Customer. And then the breakout is, maybe it's, maybe it's more of like the be the media story. Maybe it's more of, you know, maybe, like, an AI forward company, where it's really about, like, Okay, how do you, you know, how do you reconcile, like, all this, like, usage, data and mediation, and get that through revenue recognition, because we're going to see that more of that now, like, so, so anyway, we have to figure out what those look like. But that's, that's the concept. So we are all aligned that the story adapts depending on who we're talking to. And I think the question is, what, what is the core message and that we think we can get people excited about as we're walking through the product?\n\nSpeaker 3  39:52 That's why I like Andrew's story flow, because to me, it's all if we we build Andrew's story from a B to be SaaS omni channel, company perspective, it hits most of our key product areas. It gives you a streamlined like storyline all the way through. It talks about, well, you know, you're selling to a customer who, on one day, is selling this motion, the next day, they're selling this motion, and they never have to change, because we're there with them all the way through the journey. Like to me, I think that makes a lot of\n\nUnknown Speaker  40:25 sense. The primary frame is\n\nUnknown Speaker  40:27 they can't see it also,\n\nSpeaker 9  40:35 sorry to interrupt your flow. Hopefully doesn't erase your board. I know yay.\n\nUnknown Speaker  40:44 Yeah, so it's something more like that, right?\n\nSpeaker 8  40:53 Well, yes, and no, it's more like that.

We can manage the monetization process. The monetization process is acquisition to cash.\n\nSpeaker 2  41:38 What's What's brilliant about this is the question is, do you even need the vertical line, right? What you actually do is, you're just plotting the customer. The only, the only difference is that acquisition, that, yeah, acquisition, the cash isn't temporal, right? Doesn't have a time dimension to it, self serve to self that can do right. That is us. That is a natural slider. The bottom the left at the the Y is a, is a flow. The right is a, the x or whatever that the top one is, is the, is the state of the customer.\n\nSpeaker 4  42:15 This is a good tool. I can see companies, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2  42:21 Let's put plot somebody what? What is the Doesn't everyone just play devil's advocate? Doesn't everybody? I can see the left to right and back again. Why would someone stay self serve and only on acquisition is that what we're selling them. We're not selling them the orders again.\n\nSpeaker 3  42:40 That gets into the second level story in practice, because in media clients, for example, like they don't often want to do a full acquisition to cash overhaul all at once. Their biggest problem is managing their funnel, and so they might want to start with the acquisition piece, but you're able to change the story of how we can eventually grow all the way through.\n\nSpeaker 2  43:00 Got you So are you saying then that we would go to market with acquisition to order? Though, I don't believe we've done we do that.\n\nSpeaker 3  43:09 I think that's that is a separate question we should answer. Because I does. Then that makes sense. Then I think the answer to that is no given our B to B or our SAS focus and SI,\n\nUnknown Speaker  43:20 yeah. And the CFO was like, then we\n\nSpeaker 3  43:22 wouldn't do a media acquisition order, go to market movement. We wouldn't sell Zephyr. That's the, that's the we would accept it if it came in naturally.\n\nSpeaker 5  43:34 This is how you frame the conversation at the start. Like, when you're going in to talk to a customer, you're going, right? This is where Zora fits, right? This is what we do, and this is all this today. We might be just focusing on this particular piece, but it's really important to understand that, you know, we've got them covered, and if you do decide you're going one way or the other, we can go with you. And it's kind of that Zora for life story,\n\nSpeaker 3  43:57 and the key is written,\n\nSpeaker 5  43:59 and then you get into the specifics, yeah. And we\n\nSpeaker 3  44:03 can capture you at any one of these stages and meet you there, but we have all of these stages for you. Yeah? It's avoid people's\n\nSpeaker 5  44:11 going in, like, right? I'm coming in to talk to you about billing. Let's just talk about billing and forget all the rest of the stuff.\n\nSpeaker 3  44:16 Yeah, billing,",

Like, yes, we need to figure out which of these models you're in, and actually, we probably should build architectures for each of these models.\n\nSpeaker 2  44:26 But yeah, is it? I may not be right, but I'm just, I'm just trying to think of a lot because I think you can pick that up. Maybe you can pick that apart, but if you've got that right, acquisition to cash here, self serve, to self assisted, isn't what we're actually talking about.\n\nUnknown Speaker  44:47 Yeah, I think that's a view too, that we should have in there.\n\nUnknown Speaker  44:50 Is that that central piece of the billing,\n\nSpeaker 2  44:52 that's the order, right? That's the word billing, because it does like, if I'm a self self serve here, I might go down this route, or I might go down this route and this route\n\nSpeaker 4  45:03 you're drawing a picture of, like, all the possibilities on one\n\nSpeaker 2  45:07 Yeah, but I know this. I agree with you that my only problem is this is, I don't think we're ever, no one's ever going to live up here, like this person always lives down here. Maybe this person is always, it always ends down the bottom because we're selling to the CFO. So there's always a billing component.\n\nUnknown Speaker  45:23 In it, right? That's kind of what the examples\n\nSpeaker 4  45:25 on the right. I'm trying to like, we have this framework, right? Then any particular customer you could, like, draw a picture for any customer, any of our customers. I mean, I think the principle\n\nSpeaker 2  45:36 is, if we start to acquisition, you always end in cash. But you could add, you could start a quote or order and go to cash. There's never, ever going to be an acquisition to order on its own. That's right, yeah, unless you, unless you decide, like a lucky like, we're going to lead with that, and then we're\n\nSpeaker 3  45:53 going to, but here's, here's, we got to narrow this down, though, because here's the problem.\n\nUnknown Speaker  45:57 These slides that makes sense.\n\nSpeaker 4  46:00 Customer one, yeah, in my mind, is a pure media company where we do acquisition to cash. Customer two is a pure B to B Company where we do quote to cash. Customer three is a B to B Company where we just do order to revenue. And customer four is a media company where we just do same thing order to\n\nSpeaker 3  46:21 but here's where, because you also have customers that will just go from here to here,\n\nUnknown Speaker  46:29 we're saying we don't want those.\n\nSpeaker 3  46:30 I just want to be very specific, like, that's right, we don't want those. Need to be very clear that we are not going to go out. We don't sell, just acquisition, but also make sure sales knows. Don't put your energy and building a portfolio around those\n\nUnknown Speaker  46:42 customers. My only problem with this is, right? So\n\nSpeaker 2  46:46 sorry. It's like, I think this has got to have some meaning to it. So I don't think this is a media company. This is a self serve company as my B to B, B to C, B to B, whatever it's, self ",

That any any particular customer has got to have its own fingerprint. I think that's very, very powerful. And then we could use this as the tool that we like do a demo through. And then we go, look, we're a lot of companies like, let me show you an example of whatever Twilio. You show twilio's footprint, and then let me show you BMC.\n\nSpeaker 2  47:37 And you can have, let me show you you can have your thing, which is, you see that one there? We don't do that one where the line stops in the middle.\n\nUnknown Speaker  47:45 It's not a customer that we have on site.\n\nSpeaker 3  47:50 Here's the story of a customer who started with this footprint with us, and then they changed to this fingerprint with us. Yeah, that's good. We're there the whole time.\n\nSpeaker 2  47:59 That's good. Yeah, that's really good. And then this is really good framework.\n\nSpeaker 4  48:02 The demo you're using is just showing, like, somebody who's kind of doing a lot\n\nSpeaker 3  48:05 of cool shit. Maybe that's a better demo. Say, here's a demo of a customer who started with this fingerprint. Oh, and then a year later, they changed to this fingerprint. And here's a demo of how we adapt.\n\nUnknown Speaker  48:17 Yeah, that's good. And this is really easy\n\nSpeaker 1  48:19 to connect with. The DJ, he had this vision of, like, how are we presenting the end to end story? And then when we get to a specific, you know, let's specific example, like one of these here, we flash up like a customer and say, like, hey, this demo that we're presenting here is really relevant for, like, a self service like, company, or this one's relevant for a B to B Company. And like, how can we show the end to end story? But like, through a customer example, it's like, Hey, this is why this feature is very important to this particular\n\nSpeaker 2  48:46 this is powerful because you could, you can tag every bit of content that talks to\n\nSpeaker 3  48:51 the breakouts. The breakouts, yeah, yeah. Exactly media customers are this fingerprint, yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2  48:56 I love it. You can have this really good\n\nSpeaker 5  49:00 idea that, like that centre diagram. If the reps and the essays start thinking in that way, like every time I joined a customer, what does the path look like? Yeah, and it's a spectrum\n\nSpeaker 3  49:10 tell the right story. Yeah. I actually think the diagram all the way to the left is the meta diagram. Yeah, the one in the middle and the four on the right are each individual, ideal fingerprints that we were after.\n\nSpeaker 5  49:22 Yeah, thanks, brilliant.

Yes, just get kill that self service, sales assisted. And then acquisition, the cash. The only outstanding is that, if you actually does research. I sent you an acquisition of cash acquisition. The cash is probably quite an expensive thing to build a market position in. That's the only, that's the only drawback. So it just doesn't exist.\n\nSpeaker 4  49:52 I wouldn't, I wasn't positioned as an acquisition the cash thing, I'd say, like, we do monetization, and then within that, I like your suggestion can, let's, let's snap to the business processes that actually okay.\n\nSpeaker 2  50:04 That's, yeah, I agree with that. We put our like, marketing label on the floor, yeah, okay, yeah, all right. So it's, it's a sub, it's a it's a narrative underneath the\n\nSpeaker 8  50:13 Agile monitor. So you're just saying really quick, just to capture that back, like we do intend monetization, and then, depending on who we're talking to, that includes acquisition, or that really\n\nSpeaker 4  50:21 starts with your quote. I think we should break up the monetization. What do you mean by monetization? Well, it's a full spectrum. It runs the gamut acquisition to this, to this, to this, to this, to cash, yeah. And then, like, we could talk about any part of that process where your problems\n\nSpeaker 2  50:34 are, and then across the omni channel, then you've got the omni channel across the top, which means we sell where you sell in a unified way,\n\nSpeaker 3  50:41 yeah, part of the breakout. So you're like monetization for this segment means these things, yes, this fingerprint. It means using these processes. It means using this language. You could\n\nSpeaker 2  50:53 give the reps cards right and on the back it says, that's what you selling, right here, that card all the way to the left, that goes all the way down.\n\nSpeaker 3  51:01 And by the way, Stripe only fits this.in the fingerprint. Yeah, brilliant. Charge me only does this dot. I love it. And stripe might do this fingerprint, but when you move to this fingerprint,\n\nSpeaker 2  51:12 they're not going to be Yeah. That's a very powerful way to view the business, I think, because it's super easy to get instantly.\n\nUnknown Speaker  51:21 And then you can also use these to say, look,\n\nSpeaker 4  51:25 here's here's how these three companies evolved over time, yeah, and that's why you need a platform like this, because you think you're just starting, you know, here is all you need, but eventually you're gonna do this. Yeah, totally this. Like, let me show you five companies who\n\nSpeaker 2  51:37 did this that captures the SLG to plg. The other way. That's really powerful.\n\nUnknown Speaker  51:47 So then the question is, all right, so\n\nSpeaker 4  51:50 to firm this up, I think we probably need a unified definition of these process names. Yeah, on the left here, you know. So we stop confusing ourselves. We should say this is these are the labels. I think the",

Sorry,\n\nSpeaker 3  52:15 sorry. I just seen on the labelling of the things on the Y axis. I want to make sure this is aligned on a marketing perspective. Because I think that this should be a combination of like, what we call the products in there, but also like how we want to position the marketing on our website. Because ideally this same flow would be our products\n\nSpeaker 8  52:34 that we talk about, like from acquisition to so like order. Like, we don't have a\n\nSpeaker 3  52:38 product that is order. We don't have a product that is in pricing. We have a product that is have a product\n\nSpeaker 8  52:43 that is billing, right? And billing has a whole bunch of stuff within it. That's right, yeah, that's right. And then what we're thinking we're talking about is breaking out some of the stuff that's in billing today into its own product areas, which includes payments as well as accounts.\n\nSpeaker 3  52:57 When you're talking to this type of customer with this fingerprint, yeah, billing means these things to them, but this one over here, billing means these other things. The The\n\nSpeaker 2  53:07 other thing on acquisition is you can choose the counter which is, what is not acquisition. It's not prospect, it's not lead, it's not discovery. You know, acquisition is the point that you be that the customer needs orchestration to get to the offer right.\n\nSpeaker 3  53:26 It's also not resource management, which is addresses the profession or the Correct, correct.\n\nSpeaker 7  53:33 What's the group that figures out? Like, I think it's me and\n\nSpeaker 3  53:39 Ken, because ideally I'd like to whatever we decide here and push it sko I think needs to turn into our website. I agree, yep.\n\nSpeaker 4  53:45 Well, this, I this fingerprint framework can be really powerful for the year. I agree. So it's more than just the website, right? This could just, we can print up, like\n\nUnknown Speaker  53:53 you said, deck of cards to give it.\n\nSpeaker 2  53:55 Yeah, every sales rep has a deck of cards, and on the ring, on the back, is the playbook for that.\n\nUnknown Speaker  54:00 Yeah, it's very that's actually very powerful visual as well.\n\nSpeaker 8  54:06 Or they it's like a matching game where you have, you have your playbook, and then you have to find someone with a card that is like a customer that represents that playbook.\n\nSpeaker 2  54:13 Yeah, that's cool. I like that. I like that. But I think the customers will get it as well. And the bit where you go, Listen, here's you. There's like the current story, which is your plg. You've gone out towards the edge. You've gone SLG is in this new AI world where the cack of SLG is high. You can, you can edge back into a plg motion.

I think the piece that's missing or something around, what are the cool product? Big things, one, right? Like, what's new? How far outs we want to think,\n\nSpeaker 5  55:11 and we may not need to solve that today. I mean, we want to solve it as soon as possible, but what I can do is that story flow. How about I just flesh that out a little bit more. And I've kind of got a slide for each, and I roughly just chucked in the types of areas of product that we want to talk about. If you guys want to start looking at that and slotting in. Here's the feature we want. You know, I know Shakir wants to show his homepage somewhere. We want to put some MCP stuff, probably somewhere, etc, etc. We can flesh it out using that. I guess you know this, this is all great. I think this is what you're going to be leading the discussion at, and setting the scene around the whole fingerprint. And then when we get to the demo, it's like, right? Here's an example of one that's probably almost that centre one there.\n\nSpeaker 2  55:55 Do you know what's really interesting, though, that you asked the question that beginning, why?\n\nUnknown Speaker  56:01 Why does or exist? Because,\n\nSpeaker 2  56:04 yeah, because your business is going to evolve. It's going to scale one card, it's going to adapt. That's why we exist. That's why we have so much stuff. And you want to abstract away pieces that aren't relative relevant to you. I mean, it's like the CPQ light thing. We use experiences to create a configurable CPQ, just what you need at the point that you need it. Other stories all there.\n\nSpeaker 3  56:27 Andrew and I may be, I don't know that everyone thinks this way, but like, yeah, I want to make sure we don't position AI as a thing we sell. We sell a story of solving business problems. Ai happens to be one of the latest tools that we have developed to solve your problem. Absolutely. Yeah, so\n\nSpeaker 8  56:49 and so, I think, like, we need to weave AI into this story that we tell, as opposed to having some, you know, broken out.\n\nSpeaker 5  56:57 That's why the MCB story is really good, because we're not saying we're selling you a widget, like our competitors are. We're not selling you an agent,\n\nUnknown Speaker  57:04\n\nforce, yeah, platform component.\n\nSpeaker 2  57:07 It's just ready to go. Yeah. That also ties into the acquisition to order story. So in this, in this intersection, which we're breaking out as its own roadmap, the we have this, we have this orchestration engine, which we call intelligent orchestration, which is a it's either what it is today or it becomes an agentic system that that carries the customer through from one experience to the other. So I agree with you, weaving it into the product, as opposed to it being some separate thing.\n\nUnknown Speaker  57:37 The AI is the thing that helps you\n\nSpeaker 5  57:41 move down.

It's like, no, like, none of that matters. The customer pain point matters. Yeah, agreed. UCP is our architecture that allows us to use AI to solve their pain point,\n\nSpeaker 5  58:29 and we can show some examples of how it's used, but it's not a this is a that's right\n\nSpeaker 1  58:35 in our conversation.

It's not big in Spain and so forth, right? So, net, net, the SaaS and the BG one is at 80% done for Noam.

    "content": " to be self serve, is not a high priority in anyone's mind, right? It's kind of well, and it could, it could be important in the US, which is part of how to tell the story, right? So what I want to understand is, when we go to market, how are you adapting to this road map, which is very B to B complex, SaaS driven. Does it? Do you have to kind of work around it all the time and say, Okay, well, we're gonna, you know, we can't. We actually not gonna win in in B to B self serve against stripe. We just don't go after that. We need to find this really narrow sweet spot. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you work around a business that's not actually designed to serve 60% of your market.\n\nSpeaker 2  5:20 Okay, so it's very interesting. So, so the point is, the following, the way we design it in Europe, by the way, there is something new at Zuora, for me, is every AOC that we're asking for EMEA business is kind of rejected. That's new, right? In the past, it was probably balanced, because, you know, the reality is the following, but that will give you the perception of the reality. So the reality is, we are in a US company, and 99% of the US, the global leaders, they understand just us. So they are not, in fact, global leaders. They are US leaders into a global role. This is very different, okay, the the only exception we had in the past was Robbie troby was British, and he was living in Europe, so he was exposed to Europe. So we understand that, but maybe Shakir is kind of exposed to Europe a bit more, but Ken house man is a pure product of us, right? He knows us. He breaths us. He deal with us. He thinks us first. Okay, okay, so you know, again, we can make it better, but this is something which is part of the DNA. If tomorrow I have a global role and I have to run us. I cannot find the knowledge of someone sitting in US compared to mine. And you do the opposite. That's what we have right in region. They don't really fight back for no one is they fight back effectively for no one, because this is the only market they know. But this is not only market they should know, because they are not us. They're global. I mean, it's my ongoing fight for the past 30 years is I say, Guys, if you are just leading us, you should not be leading the team globally, because us is not the world, even if Americans believe us is the world. But it will be too complex conversation anyway. So the way we do that is very simple. If this, if we don't have a B, A B to B complex, so basically, on the B to C, if we don't have a very complex case, we lose, because we have been losing all the time. So B to C, high volume with that complexity is not a sweet spot for us. So I tend to believe we should not go right or wrong. Okay, that's one thing. Second is B to B. Complex is our sweet spot, right? No complexity. If stripe can make the offer, I have 90% of chance to lose because stripe will make a bundle, which is new, by the way, for you to know Jonathan is now. Stripe is saying, Okay, if you give me the payment, right the PSP, I will make you an amazing offer on the billing side. So if that, we've just lost a deal in France against that kind of approach. They globalised billing and PSP, they were not doing that like three months ago. Is it an exception? Is it? Is it a new trend? I don't know. So the secon",

    "content": " factor that you need to keep in mind is the size of us. Us is not that big compared to Europe anymore. I give you a sense this quarter q4 the biggest quarter of the year. I am trying to do 5 million Okay, and by the way, I like very much what the team in US is doing. It's not the point. It's just to come back to reality, not to we are deliver 5 million, and Boone is trying to deliver 9 million. That's all it is. So when US is massive, I say not really is, is less than twice of the European business. Now, the thing is, we are not fighting with the same weapons. Is they have all the focus, and we have limited focus. They have all the AOC development. We struggle to get one. So at the end, if you, if you feel like a market which is by design, bigger customer base, bigger in terms of workforce, biggest on product development, and you expect EMEA to grow with what is left is difficult, right? So to your point, we select the fight because we a better way we perform well, which is one thing as well. Can we perform better? Of course, yes, because I give you, we have a few AOCs with here technologies, for example, or with canal plus, where it was rejected. What was the AOC? What was it? Sorry, the AOC is a product development.\n\nSpeaker 1  9:55 I know what it is. I just want to is someone who can tell me what the AOC, the actual AOCs?\n\nSpeaker 2  10:00 Oh, yeah, on Canal Bruce is I can get, is an AOC about the payment I can give you, the details is on top of that, he went around the product and and he came down to shaker, who said, Yeah, but you know, we, yeah, okay, we're not gonna do that for Canada, plus, because it's between brackets, just a 200k deal. Yeah, if you compare by size, we always lose because when we send 200k deal in Europe, US is probably signing 600k or seven. So if you fight back against the size of the deal, we are dead, right?\n\nSpeaker 1  10:37 There's a counter to that, and I just had to change our experiences roadmap for 300k deal for Toyota. So it's also about the size, you know, it's the it's sometimes not the size of the deal. It's just how priority the customer is as well. So that, okay, carry on, because I'm really interested in that five versus nine. I think that's a really interesting number,\n\nSpeaker 2  11:00 interesting fight, because, you know, and that's today's war eyes. Like, I don't know the exact number, probably 1000 customers ish, so we never know the final sometimes we say 1100 sometimes we say 1200 sometimes we say 1000 let's say 1000 among the 1000, we have 260, so the size of the customer base of Europe is like one force, okay, let's say 1000 US has half of the customer base, and the other one force is probably APG and Japan, right? So, so they have to be honest. I keep saying the same when you look at the size of the people, the size of the team, the size of the customer base, the size of the focus us should perform three times, four times in\n\nSpeaker 1  11:43 and in fact, I'm speaking to mark gagne tonight. He, he, he's also, he also has the problem that I'm explaining to you, which is, you know, his business is B to any and he doesn't have the kind of focus and support. So he's pushing really hard on a lot of the stuff that you were talking about. So I guess you could say then that you take, can I just ask on upsell five to do we? Do we upsell the same portion of revenue as Noam does? Or are we new business?\n\nSpeaker 2  12:19 I mean, I think this year, we have 65% of our upsells coming from instal base upsell, and 35 is coming from new business. I don't have the exact number for Noam, but I think no one is probably similar, because we a lot of upsell. So I thin",

    "content": " the ratio between new business and upsell is probably very much the same. My point is really about the total ACV you generate. And there's another thing that you know we have to remember as well, is when we have a churn problem in EMEA execution made for the zone, the zone was a very bad exception. We operate better the customers. We are not surprised by a lot of churn like we have. So we control between brackets better the future of the customer. We engage better with our customers, and I think we do a better job. We have the communities, we have the user groups, we have the all of that is creating proximity, and you lose business as well, but you are not caught by surprise. So the point is the following, if we expect, I said that to DJ, for you to know, I said, if you expect us to carry on delivering twice the business of EMEA, of sorry, of Noam, we need a game changer. You cannot tell us you need to grow the same percentage and give all the all the focus. You know, it doesn't work, yeah,\n\nSpeaker 1  13:43 so that's why we're having the conversation. Because I, it seems to me that the unlock has to be, I mean, B to C, when you think about we over index on plg and SLG, right? It's self serve and self serve and sales assisted. And you're on that spectrum, is what we discussed the other day. Yeah. So B to C, I feel like we, when we talk about B to C, people get nervous because they, they someone says retail or E commerce, and everyone goes, Oh, no, we're not B to C. No, no, no. But it's, it's, you know, it's B to C. Very verticalized. Stellantis is a really good example, right? But if you get rid of the B to C label, that's just self serve for a particular use case, right? Gonna be anybody? That could be anybody, right? So, so self serve, so, and then B to B, plg is just two things. What I'm first of all, I was looking at the billing implementations, and I spoke to clarissis, and I said, Listen, what would you need to do an implementation in four weeks? Right? Because we know we've got this big motion on AI to reduce our deployment time, but the lens for that is complex B to B SaaS, right? So take all of that complexity and remove nine months down to four months. I mean, I think it's an almost impossible task. I know that head of the data science team that's running that, and he's like, fuck me. This is just like a just a giant right? But, but when I said to to when I said to Clarice, what would it take? They said, Just give me a reference implementation, right? If I want to do a light billing implementation, so called Light billing,\n\nUnknown Speaker  15:29 just give me a framework. Just give me a reference framework.\n\nSpeaker 1  15:31 You know, just give me a like, that's what I can deploy. They said, if we'd have had a reference implementation, reference architecture for immediate we'd have given them 80% of what they wanted out of the box and then just worked on The Balancing 20% but we had to go completely Greenfield on everything. So the unlock of oh, we have to have billing light is actually misdirection. You don't need billing light. You just need reference architectures, right? That's for it. So they reckon that they could get some of their customers in the self serve space up and running within four weeks, four to five weeks, right, with a reference architecture. So that's number one. Number two, when I spoke to NAV last night, who's the chief architect here? No",

    "content": " no, yeah. So super guy. He knows where all the bodies are buried. He's been trying to do this forever. But you know, you someone has to own this story. He's we were talking about the idea of CPQ light. Now, typically, when you think about CPQ light, the CPQ team go, you know, we've got CPQ X, we've got next gen CPQ, we've got vibe quoting. We don't have any room, room in there, in the roadmap, but CPQ light is unlocked by our experiences product which sits on top of CPQ and just consumes the bits of CPQ that the customer wants. So I also went to Clarissa said, Listen, if I gave you a configurable CPQ, you put it together, or the customer puts it together, or we create an out of the box template. We make it modular exactly, but it's just like you just put a layer on top of it. You don't have to. So they said, Yeah, it's a big unlock. So so there's more of these things that we can do that are being done in this kind of scattered way that we can consolidate. So my, my question to you is, and I don't know what the timeline is, but it's not two years, and it's not a year. It's like, you know, six months. You could kind of get to this vendor for life story, if I came to you and said, Listen, here's reference architecture, here's all of the value of experiences, self serve, all that kind of stuff. Here's the CPQ light product. And then here's a, you know, some other stuff as well. It just makes the self serve that kind of 50 million to a two 50 million customer, a viable proposition. Does you said something the other day? So that would unlock 60% of our business. What I'm trying to get a sense of is, is that a major unlock, like, like, is it a big unlock, or is it, yeah, you know, we can do something with that, and we could probably win\n\nSpeaker 2  18:06 a few deals. Okay, the big unlock is not necessarily the CPQ, because, you know, there's one thing that many customers are looking at who are CPQ, because they are struggling with the Salesforce. CPQ, yeah, it's expensive. Doesn't work. A lot of custom development, a lot of promises from Salesforce, and they have fucked up by Salesforce, and they are so tired with Salesforce, they look at Zuora, okay, of course, CPQ alone, of course not. They look at Zora when we do the billing, as you could imagine, right? So that's one second is the big unlock is always the same. The big threat when we engage on, let's say, in the building, because we sell more building than growing you compared to us, right? So the big threat and we engage with the customer on the platform cost, which is sometimes a challenge, is when we come with the army, with GS, right? And GS comes with, I don't know, the platform costs you 200k and if GS costs you 200k you find that sometimes it's 200k for the platform. And GSA, from a deployment perspective, is four or 500k and then your your deal is dead, not because of the platform cost, because of the GS cost, right? And to your point, I've been asking for it forever. Why don't we come with the best practices to the customer, out of the box implementation, instead of telling them what, tell me what you want, Mr. Customer, we say we are the leader in your industry. This is a pre packaged deployment that we do. Here is how it looks like, is what you can do with that. And because it's already pre deployed on our for other customers, then we can do that in, I don't know, five days of customization. If you go like art, then it will be 20 days. Yeah, whatever, right? Because the problem is not the time it takes Jonathan is the time you have to agree to occur with the customer. Most of the delays we have is not linked to the configuration. Part is because we put so much complexity in front of the customer, they don't know what to do. And then you delay two weeks, three weeks. So if you come with a predefined per vertical, doing 80% what the customer should be doing. And we and if they say, No, no, no, it is not suitable, we say, Hold on a minute. Is not only a deployment of the billing solution. You need to rethink your processes. This is the best of breed that we do in your verticals. If you're not doing that, you're not following the best practices, and just raise the question on the customer side to say, okay, the guys saying we should not do that. You make that reflection happening today with us. What we do? We say, tell me what you want. And there is a car. So the you spoke about reference architecture. Agree with that the reference architecture should go with a pre, pre defined deployment recommendation. Yeah, for it for a while as well.\n\nSpeaker 1  21:11 Well, yeah.

    "content": "I can negotiate with Ken, but the bit that I just to play devil's advocate, let's say, I say that, and they go, Well, why do you need the vendor for life story? Why do you need self serve? Then why don't we just do reference architecture and then that that takes care of it. I mean that. Why is self serve, plus that reference architecture important is that the 60% it's like we've got 60% of our business, which is not B to B complex. We fuck up some of it because of reference, no reference architecture, so we could sell all of the self serve, but then we come with a billing implementation that for that type of customer just doesn't work. That's the story, right?\n\nSpeaker 2  21:54 And, yeah, I agree. If you take the startups, most of the time, the startups now they want assisted implementation. Why they want assisted implementation? Because, a, they want to control the implementation. B, the cost, because they give you a sense, if you go full full out deployment is 200k if you go assisted implementation is probably 60k so the shoes of a customer, small company of 40, 5060, 70, million euros. When you say it's either 50k or 200k 200k is a big number, right? You go to a viva. You say 50k or 200k doesn't matter, right? So when you do 2.5 or 3 billion pounds, you don't care about the 50k now in this on the startup scale, and we have a lot of AI companies, as you know, growing like crazy. We don't have the right approach, nor the right tool, not the right flexibility. So to your point, the reference architecture or the predefined deployment is a must have if we want to accelerate with the SaaS, in particular in Europe, because they have small companies. Our SaaS business is not done of multi billion dollar companies. We do not\n\nSpeaker 1  23:11 but, you know, there's good money, there is that there's good revenue, there is a lot\n\nSpeaker 2  23:14 of good money. There is a lot of growing companies. But see, you know, we signed trust you know, I'm sure you know trusted shops. You know, trusted shops. Okay, it's our customer in Germany. We just renewed the contract for $800,000 sorry, 800,000 euros. But it was a big headache, because they are only a 250 million customer. Is interested of a well known brand in Europe? Yes, big time. Now they are only a 300 million, because they operate in Europe, the same process of the New West will probably, I don't know, probably do 2 billion. So I mean, to your point, I think the customer, which are big customer, well established in Europe, they do 300 million, 400 million, rare, only above a billion. And we are not serving them the way it should be. And this is EMEA in us, all the companies in the range of 200 million is not a focused market for us. I believe in us. We don't follow that much, right? The SaaS business we are trying to follow is a trillion by the way. I give you an example. Every time I'm asking for an AOC, I got 90% of the time the same answer, which is, I don't know engineering is hyper busy with Twilio. Yeah, but how can this be? I can we do a deal? Again, from my view, right? I can we do a deal which was probably a very good deal, and then for months or quarters out, our engineering is working for Twilio. I don't think this is a cost effective deal, to be honest. But, you know, but you know, I give you what was the last example where Zora was beyond a big deal in Europe, none. And I can name a few in us, Twilio is the last one. Is it a good deal for the company. I don't believe so, right? Because if everybody's working for quarters on Twilio, and then I will question, right? But, but your point? I think there is one thing, is B to B, SAS, yes, in Europe, but it's not huge, massive, multi billion dollar companies in Europe is multi, 100 of millions of revenue. So you take the US business, and you divide by 10. It's our size. So when a company does 3 billion in us, in the SaaS, you bring the same company in Europe, only 300 million, you divide by and you're close to reality.\n\nSpeaker 1  25:36 But the quality of the you know your quality, I know you have to go the quality of the deal that you do, though, that is the European market. So my kind of summary is, the baseline is, you have to have a reference implementation, right? So that's, that's number one, that's like your that's like your calling card, yeah, we can get you up in four weeks. The other bit, the other bit is, well, we don't need to sell you CPQ now, or even light CPQ. We just need to give you self serve, all of that richness. But the sell I think you've got is you go and, by the way, when you grow you're going to need CPQ. That's typically where you get into trouble, right? That you have to start switching systems together, or when you get to a certain site. So just one, one last thing is the rip out of stripe, the same story as in the US. So, I mean, could a could a sauce, a smaller SARS business like you've described, just live on stripe and a patchwork of other systems? Or is there a cell that says, Listen, you come with us now at 50 mil or 100 million euros, or even, you know, below that, we'll get you up and live. We've got all the self serve. You can do all of your self serve implementation, but all this other stuff in the background, super powerful, AI, whatever that is, at some point you're going to need CPQ,",

We are then free to rewire or improve internals behind that surface. The implementation must separate the contract from engine implementation so that:\n\nwe can evolve the internals i.e. domain engines without breaking clients. This feeds into and meets our composability promise.\n\nwe can change internal algorithms or technologies without breaking clients.\n\nAt a high level the following component diagram describes the Unified Decision System/Decision Engine. Each component/Sub component is described in subsequent sections.\n\n\n\nHow does UDS/Decision Engine operate?\n\nAt a high level, the Decision Engine is a vertical pipeline:\n\nCallers construct a decision request and pass in context and payload (your inputs).\n\nThe Decision Orchestrator:\n\nroutes the request to the right policy/plan\n\nexecutes that plan by invoking domain engines in sequence\n\nperforms optimisation and guardrail checks\n\nproduces final decision artefacts.\n\nDomain Engines do the domain specific work (pricing, configuration, promotions, entitlements, approvals, recommendations).\n\nThe engine returns outputs back to the caller, and optionally emits commands to monetisation and events to the platform.\n\nThe following schematic demonstrates how a channel agnostic Commerce Foundation architecture can power commerce through Unified Decision Engine.\n\n\n\nDecision contract\n\nEvery caller i.e self service, CPQ, partner API, agentic assistant, interacts with the Decision Orchestrator via the same contract:\n\n| { \"tenantId\": \"...\", \"decisionType\": \"price:quote | offer:list | configure:validate | promo:apply | nbo | nba | approval:evaluate | .",

Everything else is an implementation detail.\n\nDecision Orchestrator: Runtime architecture\n\nThe Decision Orchestrator is a runtime component. Control plane concerns (config, compilation, lifecycle) are separate, described later. At runtime, the orchestration pipeline involves the following:\n\nCaller sends a Decision Request (per contract above)\n\nDO validates and normalises the request\n\nDO resolves which plan to run (based on tenant, decisionType, context, and control plane configuration)\n\nDO executes that plan through:\n\ndeterministic rules\n\ndomain engine calls\n\noptimisation\n\nguardrails and finalisation\n\nDO returns outputs and logs a full decision trace.\n\nDO consists of several Run time components.\n\nRun Time Components\n\nDecision API\n\nSingle entry point into the Decision Engine.\n\nValidates decisionType, required fields, tenant.\n\nNormalises context and payload to internal structures.\n\nHooks in authN/authZ and correlation ids via standard IDP (say OneId).\n\nDecision Router (or Plan Resolver)\n\nGiven (tenantId, decisionType, optional scenario/mode, context attributes), the plan resolver selects the plan id and version to execute from the Plan Store (control plane).\n\nThe plan encodes:\n\nwhich stages run in which order\n\nwhich domain engines are invoked at each stage\n\nwhich rule sets and guardrails apply\n\nThis is where we interpret \u201cprice:quote maps to [Eligibility >> Packaging rules >> Pricing waterfall >> Promotions >> Optimisation]\u201d.\n\nNote: we don't have to go all the way and choose the pieces of this component that we want to implement. For example, we don't need to go all the way to build an entire executable plan. We can center ourselves on predefined recipes that execute a predefined order of operations but have a dynamic set of rules and constraints (as phase 1).\n\nIn nutshell Decision Router:\n\nMaps decisionType (and optionally scenario/mode) to a configured decision pipeline (sequence of domain engines calls through various stages of operation/orchestration).\n\nmaps a price:quote/cart request to [Eligibility > Packaging rules > Pricing waterfall > Promotions > Optimisation].\n\nIt also deci",

It serves as an intuitive entry point for all deals, whether they are simple, high velocity transactions or the initial shaping of a complex, strategic engagement.\n\nThe guiding design philosophy is to empower the rep, not to constrain them: \"Don\u2019t block; guide on demand\". It is a companion to the formal CPQ system, designed for exploration, speed, and fluidity before a deal is committed to the official system of record.\n\nFunctional Specs {#functional-specs}\n\nKick Start the Quote: The Sales rep is allowed to upload a presentation, excel sheet, a pdf - any unstructured data that they have prepared with their customer and get going with the conversation interface (see next) from thereon. They can kick start the flow from CRM or directly enter the Agentic Vibe Quoting platform.\n\nConversational Interface: The core of the experience is a guided, QnA flow that constructs the quote. This \"progressive disclosure\" interface asks simple, context aware questions (e.g., \"Who is the customer?\", \"What is the subscription term?\") to build the quote structure, abstracting away the underlying complexity of the product catalogue and pricing rules.\n\nTemplate Driven Creation: To accelerate common quoting scenarios, reps can initiate a new Vibe from a library of predefined templates. These templates can prepopulate customer information, product bundles, and commercial terms for specific deal types like \"New Business - Mid-Market\" or \"Enterprise Renewal\".\n\nReal Time Preview: A persistent, dynamic preview of the final order form is always visible on the screen. This panel updates in real-time as the rep makes selections, providing instant visual feedback and eliminating the need to generate a full PDF to see the impact of a change.\n\nAI Powered Recommendations: The Intelligence Service proactively suggests relevant product bundles, upsells, and cross-sells directly within the interface. These recommendations are based on historical data of successful quotes, customer firmographics, and the current quote context, helping reps maximise deal value.\n\nScenario Modelling: Reps have the ability to create and compare multiple \"what-if\" scenarios within a single Vibe. This allows them to model different product configurations, discount levels, or payment terms and instantly see the impact on key deal metrics like Total Contract Value (TCV), Annual Contr",

Instead, I am going to write this piece for the Next Generation of CPQ at Zuora. The connotation of Next Gen CPQ is that it is a separate CPQ that sits away from CPQ that is used by our current customers; on the other hand, Next Generation of CPQ analyses a true strategic vision for what should be Zuora\u2019s overall CPQ offering in say June 2026.\n\nRelated Documents\n\nProduct Architecture Specs: Agentic Vibe Quoting Architectural Perspective for Next Gen of CPQ: Thought Piece\n\nThis document is structured in multiple tabs. Please go through the relevant tabs as needed.\n\nBackground\n\nWhat do we have ?\n\nWe already have a CPQ offering that allows customers to build quotes, view metrics, handle ramps, implement multi subscription quoting, generate quote docs and integrate with Zuora billing. This CPQ is native to Salesforce and is installed as a managed package. There is 2 way sync established with Quote data saved in Salesforce and Accounts, Subscription (and related data) synced back to Salesforce from Zuora Billing. This CPQ relies on Salesforce as platform to achieve several functional outcomes:\n\nApprovals\n\nRBAC (role-based access control)\n\nIntegrations and workflows (triggers, flows)\n\nQuote notifications\n\nIntegrated Quote reporting\n\nWhat works (as listed in the paragraph above)\n\nProduct browsing and selection\n\nCore quote creation\n\nRamps\n\nMulti subscription quoting\n\nIntegration with billing\n\nWhat does not work\n\nThis can be divided into 2 main categories: Functional, that we just haven\u2019t been able to get to/capability gap, and 2) architectural limitations. I am not mentioning the parity gaps against billing in this section.\n\nFunctional gaps include features such as deal scoring, goal seeking, native approval mechanism, advanced document generation, detailed metrics etc.\n\nArchitectural limitations may not really be limitations but at this point, can be grouped along with - this includes reliance on Salesforce and its platform, limited to Zuora Billing, Scale especially when it comes to rules. (Governer limits, heap size, CPU timeout)\n\nOne key aspect that must be analyzed is the cause behind the spread of our customers across CPQ versions. I am not very close to the reasons for why customers don\u2019t change but I have been in front of customers where I have had first hand realisation that customers simply \u201ccannot\u201d change - not just easily but it takes a considerable effort.\n\nSome of the recent enhancements have helped this CPQ cover some of the gaps. Some of these recent advancements include:\n\nMulti subscription quoting\n\n?\n\nIt should be noted that these recent enhancements require their baking time and current adoption rate is \\<xx/>\n\n\n\n\n\nExtensibility\n\nUI extensibility through Extensibility Framework (JS)\n\nBackend and logic extensibility through Rules and Custom Actions (Apex)\n\nObjectives\n\nZuora\u2019s strategic objectives for CPQ include:\n\nGet maximum share of 7000 SF customers\n\nConvert the pricing model for existing Zuora customers to seat based and recover additional $xx mn ARR\n\nEstablish its position as a technology leader in AI first CPQ and Commerce\n\nFunctional parity and beyond with best in class CPQ in the market\n\nTo quantify and make these goals SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound), we need to answer a few questions:\n\nHow many customers out of the aforementioned 7,000 can we practically acquire\n\n[satish] based on the screenshot from a recent webinar which discussed about SF CPQ migration with several end customers, we potentially have a target of 5600 customers.[extrapolating from the survey below, 80% of 7000 plan to leave SF CPQ]\n\nhttps://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/console/apollox/mainEvent?\\&eventid=5008047\\&sessionid=1\\&username=\\&partnerref=\\&format=fhvideo1\\&mobile=\\&flashsupportedmobiledevice=\\&helpcenter=\\&key=BBCBFCC0E5C879F5E5D318BD1E6F0D5A\\&newConsole=true\\&nxChe=true\\&newTabCon=true\\&consoleEarEventConsole=true\\&consoleEarCloudApi=false\\&text_language_id=en\\&playerwidth=748\\&playerheight=526\\&eventuserid=769774890\\&contenttype=A\\&mediametricsessionid=663013426\\&mediametricid=7035010\\&usercd=769774890\\&mode=launch\n\n\n\nWhat is the profile of those customers\n\nHow",

Key point being we cannot force the customers to change their CRM. CPQ must fit into the ecosystem.\n\nWhat % of our target market uses Salesforce as their CRM. The point being that if 2/3rds or more of our target market uses Salesforce as a CRM then we must perfect our fitment into Salesforce because that market itself is huge. It is best to not spread ourselves thin.\n\nThe additional effort required to build adapters to other CRMs and stabilise over time with parity must not outweigh the ROI i.e. number of customers/deals we acquire on those CRMs.\n\nHence, my recommendation is that unless our target market is heavily spread (which I don\u2019t think it is), we focus on Salesforce as our CRM host.\n\nOvercome the Salesforce limitations - Salesforce limitations such as API limits are often talked about as one of the major constraints for delivering a best in class CPQ. Having said that, we are seeing the advent of CPQs (such as Nue) that are working on Salesforce and are eating into our market share. Apart from this, the other constraint is extensibility using Apex. Customers extending the capability of our CPQ using Apex coding often end up creating an ecosystem within an ecosystem that has presented us tall challenges even in migration of CPQ versions.\n\nBilling Agnostic: I won\u2019t go into too much detail into this but unlike CRM agnostic objective, this one is much more natural and straightforward. We can achieve it using Adapter design patterns and in fact the same can be achieved via the Integration framework that is being built. The core of this is to encapsulate the 2 way billing data model complexity and billing concepts of a provider from CPQ. CPQ has a grammar of its own and will not worry about the contract laid out by external providers. Instead this work will be handled by the Integration framework. More on this later.\n\nScale: \\<>\n\nLimitations of Salesforce as platform for CPQ\n\nGovernor limits\n\nDependence and hence royalties\n\nSpecific niche dev skills (SF development)\n\nRestrictive in being able to utilising core assets as back and forth calls consume SF APIs and end up being time consuming\n\nOptions\n\nBroadly, we have two options for the next generation of CPQ.\n\nEnhance the existing CPQ Develop a new CPQ Existing customers continue to use this CPQ and are offered new features Existing customers will be migrated in some way, shape or form. It could be feature level migration, cohort based migration, double dip transition. We will leave out the objectives such as CRM agnostic, Billing agnostic behind in order to achieve it. Can build adapters but see the next point. It is still going to be important to focus on Zuora Billing and Salesforce CRM to start with. Focus only on Salesforce Eventually we can target other CRMs too but there must be one focus in the beginning to do it well. Continue to leverage Salesforce platform features.

This is to support the objective of offering new features and billing parity to be able to move customers to a seat based licensing.\n\nUnderlying hypothesis being that by offering a richer CPQ we will be able to uplift the current contracts\n\nTo be a leader in AI first, we may not be able to wait for a new CPQ to come up and offer AI based capability. Hence, there will be a time of parallel efforts spent into the AI based enhancements.\n\nThe Third Approach\n\nThere is a third approach though. Knowing that migration of existing customers is a notorious undertaking and Zuora already has a majority of customers spread across the version other than the latest one, it is imperative to derisk our endeavour. Migration can be derisked by building new CPQ as fully backward compatible or by building bridges and translators but there is still an element of customer migration, SOPs, data model transition, and an obvious biggest factor being resistance due to competing priorities.\n\nImagine a world where the customers using existing CPQ (lets say we limit these to CPQ 9 and 10), can continue to use their established ecosystem but can leverage a brand new Fully AI native experience in Zuora\u2019s CPQ-X AI as well. I will illustrate this with a few scenarios and then articulate what this option may look like.\n\nScenario 1 Customer is using CPQ X (or 9). Has implemented basic product selection, offers a couple of products and has a couple of quote templates that the sales rep chooses before generating a quote.\n\nScenario 2 Customer is using CPQ X. Has implemented a flavour of guided selling using product filters that enables the sales rep to put together a quote with an array of products. They have also implemented product level rules that enable them to discount based on quantity or set of products.\n\nScenario 3 Similar to Scn 2 but the customer has implemented an array of rules that enforce product compatibility and has auto selection of Quote templates based on the context of the quote and opportunity. Sales rep can override the template and choose from a set of 10 templates.\n\n\u2026 and so on.\n\n\n\nThe New World Order\n\nVision We evolve Zuora CPQ in a dual mode architecture:\n\nKeep CPQ X as the enterprise grade, structured quoting engine.\n\nAdd Agentic CPQ which is an autonomous, AI powered quoting assistant that can read catalog and quote rules, rate cards, and even interpret custom Apex quoting logic to produce identical or improved outcomes.\n\nThe customer decides how and when to adopt the Agentic model. Switching back to CPQ X remains seamless.\n\nKey Principles\n\nNo Heavy Migration: Existing catalog, rules, approvals, and Apex customisations are leveraged directly by the Agentic CPQ.\n\nCode Aware Agents: We train the Agentic CPQ on customer specific Apex logic, so output matches CPQ X behaviour. Alternatively, if there is a flow that is customised, it can become an agent of its own. This is where we can actually implement the Concierge-Special Agent architecture.\n\nPotential Progressive Adoption: Start with \u201cAssist Mode\u201d (agent recommends, CPQ X executes), then move to \u201cAutonomous Mode\u201d. We can choose on the spectrum of fully ready Agentic CPQ to Assistance Mode.\n\nFeature Convergence: Enhancements like Product Configurator, Deal Room, and Iframe Embedding apply to both CPQ X and Agentic CPQ. These additional features will be wrapped in microservices.\n\nBidirectional Interoperability: A quote started in Agentic CPQ can be resumed in CPQ X, and vice versa.\n\nConsiderations\n\nFollowing this approach implies that Agentic CPQ doesn\u2019t need to have conventional quote generation experience. Any enhancements in that experience will be made in CPQ-X (version XI ? ).\n\nDeal Room, Deal Scoring etc will be available in the next version of CPQ X.\n\nGoal Seek will be an agent that generates quotes (doesn\u2019t have to be just goal seek).\n\nDocument Generation will also be available in Agentic CPQ.\n\nAll the elements and data will be available to both the CPQ applications.\n\nData Model enhancements such as Agreement, Proposal will eventually be made available to both.\n\nNote that data model enhancements may not be readily available in CPQX and hence an adapter will be required.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgentic CPQ\n\nDeliver a conversational, agent orchestrated quote experience with zero migration pain.\n\nPreserve deterministic outcomes by executing existing Apex logic via an adapter layer\n\nPrimary Actors\n\nSales User (human)\n\nQuote Builder Agent (QBA) - orchestrator; owns",

It aims at thinking about the next gen CPQ at a high level and gradually diving deeper into each component/module thereby forming a functional understanding of what we need to build. This understanding will comprise component design, interfaces, and information schema.\n\nSome goals that are at the forefront while drafting this document:\n\nDecouple CPQ from CRM and Billing stacks.\n\nOutperform Logik.io (configuration depth) and Salesforce RLM (flexible domain model).\n\nDeliver solution & product selling via reusable templates, dynamic rules, and catalog entities/config/relationships.\n\nProvide a Billing agnostic adapter covering Zuora, Stripe, Metronome, Chargebee, and more in future.\n\nMaintain full auditability with immutable snapshots and fine grained workflow states.\n\n\n\n(See the Component and System Interactions)\n\nPrinciples\n\nPrinciple Why it matters for CPQ Domain driven, microservice MCP Keeps fast moving catalog/config/quote logic separate, lets each domain scale and upgrade independently. API first & headless UI All functions are callable via gRPC/REST + GraphQL. Lightweight React/Next widgets embed in SF, Dynamics, HubSpot, Deal Room, partner portals.

Multiorg, multi tenant Shared services, tenant scoped data, pluggable RBAC (IAM) as described in PRD user profiles section . AI native Isolate AI inference behind a sidecar \u201cAI Framework\u201d service; agents can call catalog, pricing, quote services with minimal extra latency.

In fact, Zuora should have only one Configurator. As such, it is a candidate for standalone development and can be considered for prioritisation. Since the configurator in its real sense is an orchestrator that executes rules based on an input and generates the output that leads to update of the line items, it is in fact an extension of the existing Zuora rule engine (or any rule engine in general), it helps our case to ship something central.\n\nAnother such component is Metrics Domain. Zuora has struggled with metrics - with orders, with quotes and everywhere. Developing this as a separate service can be really powerful. My recommendation is that the Analytics team should build metrics as a service that is central across Zuora\u2019s product suite.\n\nHigh Level Functional Flows/Actions and Ownership\n\nFunctional Action Description User Role System/Component Involved Browse and Filter Catalog Navigate categories, filter by attributes, guided selling filters Customer (Self serve), Sales Rep Catalog Service Configure Products Choose attributes, enforce compatibility and selection rules Customer (Self serve), Sales Rep Configurator Service Compare Products Comparison of features, attributes, pricing Customer, Sales Rep Catalog + UI Layer Create Quote Create new draft quote manually or from catalog/configurator Sales Rep, Customer (self serve) CPQ Engine (Quote Manager) Generate Quick Quote Auto generated simple quotes for smaller deals Sales Rep CPQ Engine + Pricing Engine Version Quotes Create, edit, and manage multiple versions of quotes Sales Rep CPQ Engine (Version Manager) Apply Discounts Apply manual or guided discounts Sales Rep Pricing Engine, Rules Engine Config Bundles and Subscriptions - building Solutions Configure static, dynamic, and head bundles; create new or modify subscriptions Sales Rep Configurator + Subscription Manager Deal Room Collaboration Share quotes internally/externally for review and negotiation Sales Rep, Approvers, Customers Deal Room Service Apply Pricing Rules / Promotions Automatically apply conditional discounts or promos System (Pricing Engine) Pricing Engine, Promotion Engine Approval Workflow Trigger approval based on thresholds (e.g., discount > X%) Sales Rep, Approver Approval Workflow Engine Change Quote Terms Modify payment terms, contract periods, billing start dates Sales Rep CPQ Engine + Billing Integration Contract Finalisation Create contracts from quotes, handle redlining and signing Sales Rep, Legal CLM Integration (Contract Lifecycle Management) Push to Billing Push finalised quotes/orders to billing system (Zuora, Stripe, etc.) System Billing Adapter Layer Order Creation Convert accepted quotes into orders Customer, Sales Rep Order Management Quote Metrics Calculation Calculate ARR, TCV, MRR, discount %, margin % per quote/version System Metrics Engine inside CPQ\n\nComponent Design\n\nComponent Responsibility Classification Catalog Service Manages product discovery, search, filtering, comparison External Integration Configurator Service Manages attribute selection, rules enforcement, option dependency management CPQ native experience.

Zuora doesn\u2019t support it today. Each product can have its own set of attributes and as such it is more dynamic set of KVs that can be stored as JSON\n\nHas already been discussed and is definitely doable.\n\nProduct Categories: Taxonomy for classification and filtering, supporting guided discovery and compatibility enforcement\n\nCategory has to be on the product and other first level entities. Current category is not really useful\n\nFeatures & Entitlements: Breakdown of what\u2019s included in the product. Powers benefit based selling, entitlement driven configuration, and attribute level pricing triggers.\n\nNesting of features to allow solution selling and complex relationships\n\nFeature relationship and Feature attributes relations\n\nFeature level pricing\n\nRate Plans / Charges / Rate Cards: Pricing container and price. For one time goods, product can be associated with the price directly, indirectly enforcing a plan behind the scenes for any backward compatibility.\n\nAttribute Based Pricing: CPQ needs to perform conditional price lookups based on selected attributes (e.g., region, storage, device type). Already supported with Contextual pricing and ABP/DP.\n\nRelationships & Compatibility: Cross product rules, substitute definitions, must have/cannot have constraints, inclusion/exclusion, relationships driven from catalog metadata.\n\nSupport for Solution Selling: The catalog must allow for grouped solutions made up of multiple configurable products, services, and entitlements across different layers.\n\nSolution can be stored as composite products.\n\nData Model (considering ground up)\n\nKey is to enable nesting of products, features, and relationships\n\nBe able to store the unstructured metadata.\n\nOptions: store the attributes separately and allow attributes to have a behaviour\n\nOr store attributes as just unstructured data on product object\n\nEntity Fields Comments Product id, sku, name, type (simple, configurable, bundle), description, category_id, status, effective_date, state, metadata_json metadata_json is a flexible unstructured KV string storing the characteristics of the product for rule based config, pricing, or guided selling. See Product Attribute object as well. Product Category id, name, description, parent_category_id, hierarchy_level Used for navigation, filtering, and nesting. It is not an attribute of the product but helps in giving the product a character such as product may belong to category \u201cComputer\u201d and by the relationship of category, it may be a parent product for another product of category \u201cStorage\u201d. In addition, category can have its own characteristics that help keep products leaner as they inherit all the properties of the category. Product Attribute id, product_id, name, datatype, validation_rule, default_value [Optional] This object can store a set of attributes. Contextual service can be extended to perform this job.  The objective is that for full configurability, attributes may have their own characteristics. With metadata_json, we can store unstructured attributes but by storing the metadata about the attributes we can enforce validations, and hence, structure the rules. This is key for the configurator. Product Attribute Value product_attribute_id, value Represents selected or available values. Drives rules and UI rendering. Product Relationship id, source_product_id, related_product_id, relationship_type (cross sell, up sell, replacement, downgrade, upgrade) Enables cross product rules and guided recommendations.

Needed for head/dynamic bundle logic.\n\nFeature and Product Feature objects will remain similar to what exists today but to allow for nesting of Features, we will need a Feature hierarchy.\n\n(Product) Configurator Service\n\nConfigurator handles complex product configurations and allows such rules/configs to be dynamically built based on attribute selections, compatibility rules, guided flows, and dependency validations. It enforces product eligibility, inclusion/exclusion, conditional visibility of features/attributes, validates cross product relationships (e.g., must have, cannot have rules, if then \\<>), and supports guided selling experiences. It guarantees that what is quoted is technically and commercially valid according to both product definitions and deal-specific conditions.\n\nExamples of Configurator Behavior:\n\nSelecting a Cloud License automatically prompts the user to choose a Data Region attribute.\n\nChoosing High Availability configuration dynamically disables incompatible single instance deployment models.\n\nChoosing High Availability configuration dynamically adds a new feature that is a must have.\n\nConfigurable bundles allow optional add ons (e.g., Support Plans) based on core product selection.\n\nAttribute driven pricing changes: selecting Premium Storage automatically increases monthly price.\n\nFurther it can be extended to:\n\nAsk contextual questions like \"Do you need disaster recovery?\" during the guided flows and based on the choice we can reveal options dynamically.\n\nConfigurator primarily will be driven by the Rules. And the rules can be:\n\nSelection rules: dependency enforcement - must have, exclude/include\n\nRelationship rules: Product \\<> Product relations\n\nApplication of hierarchies (Feature or product hierarchy)\n\nTo avoid any hardcoding, Features, Products, Plans and Pricing elements will be associated with rules to drive run time behaviour. Configurator is responsible for deciphering the context and orchestrating the rules to generate the desired outcome. Outcome can be a configured product, a warning, or an exception.\n\n\n\nPricing Engine\n\nCatalog provides base pricing for core products, however contextual, and hence for browsing; CPQ Pricing Engine computes dynamic deal specific pricing\n\nCPQ Pricing Engine applies discounts, volume tiers, ramp schedules, and customer specific terms at quote time. // we should use a core pricing engine (\u201cnew\u201d rating can do the job here)\n\nPricing decisions are context sensitive: driven by customer type, deal size, product configuration, contract terms. In our current catalog, we support contextual pricing but CPQ needs more than just that.\n\nCPQ owns financial metrics (ARR, TCV, MRR), not Catalog; hence it must control pricing computation.\n\nOverall, Pricing Engine will sit outside CPQ but it will need to support all the permutations that a certain purchase flow requires.It is a stateless microservice invoked synchronously.\n\nThe inputs are (product details, attributes, qty, attribute-values, dates) and the output is (listPrice, netPrice, discountBreakdown, rampSchedule, tax).\n\n// it is also important to keep the core logic of pricing in one place for the entire product suite. Hence, CPQ should document the requirements and leverage the central pricing engine.\n\nExamples:\n\nA customer purchasing 1-10 units pays $100 per unit, but buying more than 10 units triggers a $90 per unit tiered price.\n\nA SaaS subscription configured for usage based billing charges $0.05 per API call, with monthly minimums automatically enforced.\n\nA bundled offer where selecting Product A and Product B together applies a 15% bundle discount dynamically.\n\nCustomers in \"Enterprise\" segment automatically qualify for negotiated pricing pulled during quote generation.\n\nMulti year quotes automatically apply ramp schedules where Year 1 pricing is discounted, and full price resumes in Year 2.\n\nQuotation Engine (QE)\n\nA single, auditable workspace to draft, negotiate, approve, and fulfil any \u201ccommercial scenario\u201d.\n\nNet new purchases, renewals, mid term amendments, partial cancellations, ramps, composite solution deals.\n\nTemplate driven UI & workflow via Proposal Template / QuoteTemplate (layout, default terms).\n\nBilling aware separation of sales intent (Quote Line Item) vs. billing execution (Quote Charge Detail).\n\n### New Quote Flow\n\n#### CRM Opportunity >> Proposal Creation\n\nTrigger: User clicks 'Create a Proposal' on the CRM Opportunity page.\n\nContextual Data:\n\nCustomer Information\n\nContact Information\n\nLocation Information\n\nOpportunity Information\n\nCompany Information\n\nHistory and Metrics (TCV, ACV)\n\nPrice Guidance (if applicable)\n\nAny additional context attributes\n\nAPI Call:\n\nPOST /proposal/create\n\nModule: Core Quote and Proposal service\n\nPurpose: Triggers the creation of a Proposal in CPQ, initialises Quote UI\n\nInput: Contextual Data from CRM\n\nOutput: Proposal ID, Draft quote initialisation\n\nInterfaces: CRM >> Proposal Service >> DB >> UI renderer\n\nDatabase Interaction: Save initial proposal",

Quote Document Rendered customer facing document (PDF/HTML) bound to a single Quote version. Generated post approval, pre-signature via Document Service. Captures exact commercial terms sent to customer; stored for compliance. Proposal Document? Proposal can aggregate multiple Quotes; each Quote may have distinct pricing and terms. Document must lock to the specific Quote version that the customer signs. Since Proposal is an envelope, it can be packaged after all the quotes are signed.

Traditionally, reaching these targets has been a manual, trial and error process wherein sales reps adjust quantities, discounts, or terms until the quote meets a goal. This approach is time consuming and prone to error. There is a clear need for a smarter solution that can \u201cgoal seek\u201d an optimal quote configuration automatically.\n\nIn other words, CPQ should assist the user by back solving from the desired outcome (the goal) to the quote parameters, much like Excel\u2019s Goal Seek works for formulas but on a far more complex scale.\n\nIn a world where monetisation is augmented by AI, a next generation CPQ can act as an intelligent assistant to optimise quotes within given constraints. This Quote Assist or Goal Seek capability would allow a user (or even an AI agent) to specify a business goal. For example -\n\n\u201cAchieve a 3 year TCV of $500k while keeping the product mix constant\u201d or \u201cLimit the customer\u2019s monthly payment to $10k\u201d\n\nIt is a must to have the system find the combination of prices, discounts, quantities, and terms to meet that goal.\n\nThe benefit is twofold: sales efficiency (faster, data driven quote iterations) and commercial optimisation (maximising revenue or margin within policy limits). The number of variables that impact deal outcomes can be so vast that it\u2019s \u201cimpossible for human analysis to understand the risk that comes with adjusting a few levers in pursuit of a specific goal\u201d . We are at the confluence of a technology revolution that can solve it. An AI driven approach can sift through these variables and constraints to find solutions that a human might miss, giving organisations confidence that they\u2019re delivering optimised quotes without violating business rules.\n\nThis document, written from an Architect\u2019s perspective, proposes a comprehensive design for a Goal Seek/Quote Assist module in Zuora\u2019s next generation CPQ. We will introduce the problem and its facets, explore solution approaches (both functional and technical), discuss the mathematical optimisation models that could be employed, and outline how such a module integrates with existing CPQ and policy frameworks. Competitor offerings and industry trends will be referenced where relevant.\n\nThe goal is to provide product managers, architects, executives, and engineers with a thorough, practical, and forward looking blueprint for an AI powered quote optimisation capability that can disrupt the market.\n\nThe Need for Goal Seeking in Quoting\n\nWhy is \u201cgoal seeking\u201d needed in CPQ?\n\nTraditional CPQ tools excel",

We will introduce the problem and its facets, explore solution approaches (both functional and technical), discuss the mathematical optimisation models that could be employed, and outline how such a module integrates with existing CPQ and policy frameworks. Competitor offerings and industry trends will be referenced where relevant.\n\nThe goal is to provide product managers, architects, executives, and engineers with a thorough, practical, and forward looking blueprint for an AI powered quote optimisation capability that can disrupt the market.\n\nThe Need for Goal Seeking in Quoting\n\nWhy is \u201cgoal seeking\u201d needed in CPQ?\n\nTraditional CPQ tools excel at applying configured pricing rules (like volume discounts or bundle pricing) and ensuring product compatibility, but they largely rely on the user to manually adjust parameters to reach a desired outcome . For example, if a sales rep has a target price in mind, they might tweak the discount field repeatedly until the quote total matches that target. This is essentially a manual goal seek.\n\nAs deal structures become more complex (recurring subscriptions, usage based charges, multi year contracts with varying billing schedules, etc.), the space of possible adjustments grows exponentially. A rep might ask:\n\n\u201cWhat if we extend the contract term from 1 year to 3 years: how does that impact ACV and cash flow?\u201d or \u201cWhat discount do I need to hit the customer\u2019s budget of $50k annually?\u201d or \u201cIs there a different product configuration that meets the customer\u2019s requirements at a lower cost?\u201d\n\nEach of these questions is a what-if scenario involving multiple variables. Manually exploring these scenarios is inefficient and risks suboptimal outcomes. A Goal Seek capability addresses these problems by letting the user specify the goal and letting the system do the heavy lifting to find the solution.\n\nCategories of Goals\n\nThere are a few key categories of goals that Quote Assist should handle:\n\nPrice or Revenue Targets: This includes hitting a specific ACV, TCV, or gross margin.\n\nFor instance, a SaaS company might want to ensure a quote yields an ACV of at least $100,000, or a services firm might target a 40% margin on a professional services deal.\n\nThe goal seek engine would adjust pricing parameters (unit prices, discounts, one-time fees, etc.) or suggest upsell/cross-sell items to meet that revenue target.\n\nIn essence, the user defines \u201cmake the total \\= X\u201d or \u201cmake the margin \\= Y%\u201d and the system finds how.\n\nSome CPQ vendors have started addressing this in narrow ways. For example, Salesforce CPQ allows reps to enter a Target Customer Amount at the quote or group level, which automatically back calculates the required discount to reach that total.\n\nHowever, this is limited to a single discount field adjustment.\n\nOur vision is far broader: multi variable price goal seeking across the entire quote. Notably, Provus introduced an AI Goal Seek feature that \u201cwill generate pricing scenarios for achieving specified revenue or margin goals\u201d. This underscores the demand for intelligent revenue targeting tools.\n\nCash Flow and Payment Goals: In many industries (especially those offering subscription or financing options), the payment schedule and payment terms are as important as the total price. A customer might say, \u201cI can afford at most $5,000 per month\u201d or \u201cI have a $20,000 capex budget now, put the rest in operating expenses over the next 2 years.\u201d\n\nHere the goal seek is about cash flow optimisation i.e., structuring upfront vs recurring payments, or adjusting billing frequency, term lengths, and financing, to meet a cash flow profile.\n\nFor example, extending a contract term from 2 years to 3 years might lower the annual payment, or introducing quarterly billing could align with the customer\u2019s budget cycles.\n\nThe Quote Assist should handle such goals by considering all payment related variables: term duration, billing frequency, financing options (zero upfront vs partial upfront), payment schedule etc.\n\nThe outcome might be a rebalanced payment schedule that matches the customer\u2019s budget constraints while still delivering the product value.\n\nCurrently, sales reps often do this by hand (e.g., manually splitting charges or offering custom payment terms).\n\nAutomating this would be a strong differentiator, especially for solution bundles that combine one time fees (which could be financed) with recurring charges.\n\nProduct and Entitlements Fit: Another facet of quote assistance is recommending the optimal product mix or configuration to meet a customer\u2019s stated needs or budget. This is akin to guided selling but with an optimisation twist.\n\nFor example, a customer might describe requirements (features needed, usage levels, etc.), and instead of the rep picking a pre packaged bundle, the system can suggest which products, service tiers, or entitlements best fulfill those needs at the best price.\n\nOr conversely, the customer might say, \u201cI want everything in your Gold package, but I cannot spend more than $50k annually\u201d.\n\nA goal seek mechanism could then attempt to adjust the package; maybe reduce",

This is akin to guided selling but with an optimisation twist.\n\nFor example, a customer might describe requirements (features needed, usage levels, etc.), and instead of the rep picking a pre packaged bundle, the system can suggest which products, service tiers, or entitlements best fulfill those needs at the best price.\n\nOr conversely, the customer might say, \u201cI want everything in your Gold package, but I cannot spend more than $50k annually\u201d.\n\nA goal seek mechanism could then attempt to adjust the package; maybe reduce the quantity of certain add ons or switch to an annual billing with a discount, to meet the budget goal without removing core entitlements.\n\nIn essence, this is configuration optimisation: finding the right combination of products, options, and quantities that maximises value for both customer and vendor under given constraints.\n\nThis overlaps with classic guided configuration and needs based recommendations (often powered by AI analysing past deals or customer usage patterns).\n\nFor instance, CPQ systems like Tacton emphasize AI driven product recommendations to ensure every offer is relevant and profitable . Our proposed Quote Assist module would incorporate this by treating certain product choices as variables in the goal seek process i.e. if the goal is cost reduction, it might suggest a cheaper product variant; if the goal is feature maximisation within a budget, it finds the best combination of entitlements that fit the cap.\n\nBy addressing these three facets - Pricing targets, Cash flow constraints, and Product fit, a Quote Assist module can cover a wide range of real world use cases. It essentially transforms the quoting exercise from a one shot configuration into a multi dimensional optimisation problem, solved with AI/algorithms in seconds. This not only saves time but also systematically explores options that a human might overlook, delivering more optimal quotes. The end result is a quoting process that is goal driven rather than purely input driven: the user tells the system what they want to achieve, and the system figures out how to achieve it (if possible).\n\nVariables and Constraints in Quote optimisation\n\nEnabling goal seeking in CPQ requires clarity on which variables the system can adjust and what constraints must be respected. In a typical quote, there are numerous parameters that affect the outcome (price, cost, value) of the deal. Our solution must identify which of these parameters are allowed to change during the optimisation and which are fixed, either by user choice or by policy.\n\nVariables\n\nCategory Description Examples Product Selection Which products or services are included. Include optional add on X or not. Product Configuration & Entitlements The specific configuration of a product, such as edition or feature tier, and included entitlements. Basic vs Premium tier; Standard support vs Premium support. Quantity The number of units, seats, or usage volume. 500 licenses; 10 devices. Price Components Unit prices or rates for each item. Discounts or markups can apply at line or overall deal level. System may apply extra discount to meet target price. Recurring vs One Time Charge Balance Balance between one time charges (setup, equipment) and recurring charges (subscription, maintenance). Costs can shift between upfront and recurring. Reduce upfront fee and increase recurring fee to ease customer cash flow. Contract Term Length Duration of the subscription or contract. Term length affects pricing and discounts. Longer commitments may unlock discounts; shorter terms may raise ACV. Billing and Payment Schedule Defines billing frequency and payment timing. Impacts cash flow. Monthly, quarterly, annual, or milestone billing; upfront vs arrears payments. Financing Options Alternate payment structures for large one time costs. Instead of $30k upfront, pay $1k/month for 30 months. Entitlement Levels or Service Levels Support or SLA levels may be chosen separately from product tier. Cheaper support levels may reduce total cost. Quantity based Tier Adjustments Adjusting committed usage volume can change unit prices (volume discounts). Committing to 20% more usage lowers per-unit cost enough to meet target. Timing Constraints Deal terms related to start date or deferrals for cash flow alignment. Customer defers billing start by one quarter. Other T\\&C Commitment, payment terms, commitment layout can alter the pricing and cash flow as well. Customer wants to pay for $1M annual commitment over 2 quarters.\n\nNot all variables will be in play for every scenario. The user (or an admin default) will define which levers are within scope for adjustment. For example, a sales rep might lock certain fields: \u201cThe customer insists on Product A and 100 user licenses, so don\u2019t change those but feel free to adjust term, price, and optional add-ons.\u201d\n\nIn the user interface, this could be a set of checkboxes or toggles next to each quote parameter indicating whether the Goal Seek engine is allowed to modify it. By selecting the goal type and marking adjustable fields, the user essentially sets up the optimisation problem.\n\n",

By selecting the goal type and marking adjustable fields, the user essentially sets up the optimisation problem.\n\nConstraints\n\nConstraints are rules that the solution must not violate when searching for a valid quote configuration. Constraints come from multiple levels:\n\nProduct Constraints (Catalog rules): These are rules like compatibility (certain products must or must not be sold together), configuration rules (if option A is selected, option B must have a certain value), and valid ranges (min/max quantity for a product, allowed subscription terms for a service, etc.).\n\nCPQ systems traditionally enforce these via product rule engines or constraint logic.\n\nThe Goal Seek must respect them. For instance, it shouldn\u2019t add an incompatible product just because it\u2019s cheaper, or extend a subscription beyond the max term allowed for that product.\n\nThis is essentially the configuration validity constraint set by product management.\n\nWe can incorporate these as hard constraints in the solver (e.g., if product A implies product B also included, then any solution must adhere to that).\n\nThe use of a constraint solver is natural here - we can have a bunch of AI constraint solvers based on the category of the constraint and specialisation of the Solver Agent.\n\nPricing and Policy Constraints: Every organisation has pricing guardrails. These include discount limits (e.g. \u201cmaximum discount on Product X is 30% without higher approval\u201d), margin floors (e.g., \u201cdon\u2019t propose deals with less than 10% profit margin\u201d), and overall approval policies.\n\nIn a Goal Seek scenario, the system should be aware of these limits so it doesn\u2019t propose an outlaw deal.\n\nFor example, if a target price is so low that it would require a 50% discount but policy caps discounts at 40%, the engine should recognise no valid solution exists under current constraints (or flag that it would violate a policy).\n\nPolicies might also dictate which variables can change. For example - maybe sales is not allowed to alter billing frequency for certain product lines, or cannot extend term beyond 36 months without approval.\n\nAll such policies should be modeled as constraints. A robust design would include a Policy Configuration interface where business admins define these rules.\n\nIt is possible that some already exist in the CPQ (as part of approval workflows or price rules). It might even have a mode to override or relax constraints with proper approvals, but by default it operates within allowed bounds.\n\nCustomer specific Constraints: Sometimes a particular customer has negotiated terms that must be honored. For example, a specific client might already have a price agreement in place (perhaps via a contract or an enterprise license agreement) that sets a fixed price for a certain product or a cap on annual price increases. Or the customer simply insists, \u201cWe cannot go above $X in year one.\u201d\n\nThese effectively become additional constraints on the solution.\n\nIn CPQ, customer specific pricing or terms are often handled via contracted pricing or account specific discounts.\n\nThe Goal Seek engine should incorporate those inputs as fixed parameters or constraints.\n\nIf a customer has a pre-negotiated 20% discount on all software, the engine should work from that adjusted price baseline, not list price.\n\nIf the customer\u2019s procurement policy forbids multi year commitments, then extending term is not an option in the goal seek.\n\nOrganisational or Segment Constraints: At a higher level, the company might have strategic constraints or playbooks: e.g., \u201cFor deals in EMEA region, no more than quarterly billing\u201d (perhaps for compliance), or \u201cWe do not allow terms longer than 5 years\u201d, or \u201cWe don\u2019t finance hardware for customers in certain risk tiers\u201d. These overarching rules ensure the solution aligns with business strategy and risk tolerance. They would be configured likely at an org level or segment level in the policy engine.\n\nIn summary, the policy control must be multi layered and highly configurable, spanning product level, customer level, and global constraints.\n\nWe envision a Policy Rules component that feeds into the Goal Seek engine. It enforces T\\&C and other associated rules/constraints. This component could be part of the CPQ admin settings where administrators define: Discount limits per product or product family, margin requirements, allowed ranges for terms, approved financing options, customer exceptions, etc. The Goal Seek engine will treat these as inviolable unless explicitly told that a particular run is exploring beyond policy (and even then, it should flag violations clearly).

Maintaining trust is crucial and I strongly believe that users (and approvers) will only adopt an AI suggested quote if they know it won\u2019t accidentally break a rule and cause problems downstream.\n\nNote\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that because of constraints, sometimes Goal Seeking may find no feasible solution. In those cases, the Quote Assist should gracefully handle it by informing the user which constraint is most problematic (e.g., \u201cCannot meet the $50k target without exceeding max discount 30% on Product A\u201d). This could allow the user to relax or request an exception for a constraint, or adjust the goal. The interplay of objectives vs constraints is at the core of the design: the module must obey the laws (constraints) of the quote while trying to bend reality to achieve the goal. In technical terms, this becomes an instance of a constrained optimisation or constraint satisfaction problem.\n\nCompetitive Landscape and Industry Trends\n\nNo single incumbent CPQ product today offers the full spectrum of goal seeking we envision (spanning price, cash flow, and configuration simultaneously). This gap is an opportunity for Zuora\u2019s new CPQ to differentiate itself as a true disruptor. By learning from what early movers like Provus and PROS are doing, and going a step further in generalising the solution, we can deliver a first of its kind comprehensive quote optimisation assistant. This will position our CPQ at the cutting edge of the industry, built with AI integration into sales processes.\n\nMoreover, it aligns perfectly with Zuora\u2019s domain of monetisation: as companies adopt new monetisation models (subscriptions, usage billing, hybrid offerings), they need smarter tools to configure and price those offerings optimally.\n\nA greenfield implementation allows us to architect this capability natively with AI and advanced algorithms, rather than bolting it on as an afterthought.\n\nProposed Solution: Quote Assist Goal Seeking Module\n\nThe mathematics behind this problem\n\nTechnically the problem is to create a solver that works on:\n\nObjective (O): Objective can be to minimise or maximise a value\n\nConstraints (C): guardrails, inequalities or equalities that must be satisfied. C is a set of such equations (c1, c2, c3..)\n\nVariables (V): values that can be adjusted. V is a set of such variables (v1, v2, v3..)\n\nQuote is modelled as a set of line items (say i line items) with product metadata, costs, tiers, and policy bounds. Decision variables are split into continuous (prices/discounts, amortised amounts) and discrete (include/exclude, tier/plan picks, term options).\n\nDecision Variables:\n\nQuantity: q where value of q > 0 (seats, devices, units)\n\nDiscount: d where discount value is a fraction i.e. % 0% \\< d \\<= 100%\n\nEligibility: y where item may be excluded or included {0,1}\n\nAnd similarly others such as\n\nContract terms\n\nInstallments\n\nEtc.\n\nConstraints\n\nThe solver must always obey business and policy rules, such as:\n\nInclusion rules (e.g., Product A cannot be sold without Product B).\n\nQuantity rules (e.g., minimum 10 seats, maximum 1,000).\n\nDiscount limits (e.g., max 20% discount on this product).\n\nMargin floors (e.g., gross margin must stay above 15%).\n\nCash flow caps (e.g., upfront must not exceed $5k; monthly must not exceed $3k).\n\nCustomer specific terms (e.g., fixed price per seat for a named account).\n\nGlobal constraints (e.g., maximum contract term 60 months).\n\nIf no solution exists within these constraints, the system must explain which rules conflict with the goal.\n\nDerived Values (system derives these)\n\nFrom those variables, the system calculates:\n\nNet Price per unit \\= List Price \u00d7 (1 \u2013 Discount).\n\nMonthly Recurring Charges (R) \\= sum of all recurring items (including any financed amounts).\n\nUpfront Payment (U) \\= all one time fees not financed (this is the minimum, recurring charges may be billed along with on first invoice).\n\nTotal Contract Value (TCV) \\= Upfront Payment + (Monthly Charges \u00d7 Contract Term).\n\nAnnual Contract Value (ACV) \\= TCV \u00f7 (Contract Term in years).\n\nObjectives (end goal: solver tries to achieve this outcome)\n\nDifferent goals translate to different optimisation",

Solver should be built for one objective only but in an Objective Chain scenario, all but one objective should be converted to constraints with tolerances (+/- delta). Having done, the final solver can then create scenarios (like Pareto scenarios) by adjusting delta values across constraints. User can denote a primary objective which then is retained as Objective and is not converted to constraint.\n\nExample: Meet ACV within 2% of X while keeping the discount minimal and minimising the increase of term length.\n\nThis can be understood as lexicographic objectives. On the other hand, there can be objectives that are non sequential but must be achieved all at once. The same strategy can work in those cases as well.\n\nChallenges\n\nFractional values for discreet quantities such as number of seats\n\nObjective Chains\n\nAdministration\n\nFunctional Architecture: N-CPQ (Administration)\n\nNavneet Jain Apr 2025\n\nAdmin Domain\n\nThe admin domain has two main components:\n\nIT/Ops Admin - IT admin configures the technical aspects of the CPQ and prepares it for Sales admins to come in and make it ready for Sales reps and deal desk.\n\nSales Admin - Sales admins are supposed to work with the journeys, templates, and rules.

Prices converted, French copy auto generated; everything else identical. Mexico Entire tree Currency MXN, locale es-MX. Gateways product maybe hidden because that product cannot be sold in Mexico.\n\nThe hierarchy stays, but currency, language, and product visibility can change per child.\n\nA child catalogue is represented as a Node in the Node/Catalog setup, with a defined parent. Typically the master catalogue will be the parent. Child catalogues inherit structure, schema fragments, and product assignments from their parent node. Local variations such as language, currency, and product visibility are introduced using the overrides property on the Node.\n\nVirtual Catalog: TBC\n\nSKU Propagation\n\nSKU: GPS-SENSOR-EU Attributes: region=[\"EU\",\"NA\"], discountPercent=10, segment=[\"B2B\",\"Education\"]\n\n(Assume that segment is an attribute)\n\nCatalog / node Why it appears there Global > Hardware > GPS Sensors Manually assigned.

Publish and rollback capability.  Each published version of the catalogue is treated as an immutable, point-in-time snapshot. This is achieved by generating a new catalogue_version_id that references specific, versioned Node definitions and Product records. Rollbacks are implemented by simply redirecting the live system to point to an earlier catalogue_version_id, enabling rapid restoration without requiring data reprocessing or transformation. Discount was rolled out incorrectly > leads to rollback in one click (to previous version). Locale & currency inheritance Node inherits locale[], currency[] from nearest ancestor unless overridden. CA child defaults to en-CA and CAD; virtual catalog overrides locale only. Rule inheritance Rules cascade down the tree; children can add or mask a parent rule. Each Node may have a set o attributes that are applied to the constituent products/plans and hence product browsing can leverage that.  The same can be implemented using product rules. Similarly, the product allocation (or plans) to a certain node should also be governed by rules (manual as a pressure release mechanism). These rules are used during the materialisation process to determine which products should be included under that Node. Master rule \u201cexclude BETA SKUs\u201d; Canada child masks it for internal testers. The rules operate on product metadata (attributes, tags, or custom fields), supporting use cases such as \u201cinclude products where discountPercent > 0\u201d or \u201cexclude products with status \\= End-of-Life\u201d. Schema extension via category Category can attach schema fragments (extra custom field set) that become available on member SKUs. These fragments extend the product data model for any product associated with that Node. Schema fragments are inherited by all descendant Nodes and are merged as part of the product schema initialisation process. This enables differentiated data models for categories (e.g. hardware vs software) without fragmenting the global schema. Node \u201cHardware\u201d adds wattage, ip_rating; only those SKUs expose the fields in API. Feature/ Entitlement propagation Node can carry entitlement bundles (features) automatically granted when any SKU under it is sold. Each node can have overriding capabilities. This allows for contextual enrichment, such as including a priority support feature for all products in a \u201cBusiness Class\u201d category without altering the core product definition. \u201cPremium Analytics\u201d node adds feature.analyticsPro. # Future Lifecycle scheduling Node can have active_from / active_to; the subtree below a given node will be hidden beyond active_to Note: I haven\u2019t used start/end date as used elsewhere in Zuora for explicit clarity of such a field.

Those extensions will be stored in Zuora\u2019s existing Custom Fields engine under a namespace like x_catalog_.\n\nWhy \u201cNODE\u201d instead of \u201cCategory\u201d\n\nUsing a single, type flagged concept and hence, object, means every current and future shelf/category/collection (static, rule driven, AI generated, bundle, seasonal, etc.) is expressed the same way. Hence, traversal, rule evaluation, ACL checks, and versioning all share one piece of code. Business users still see clear names (\u201cCategory\u201d, \u201cVirtual Catalog\u201d); the generic term NODE lives only in storage and APIs.\n\nAllows for extensibility: Two fixed levels force new tables every time we invent a different layer (say shelf or layer?) (e.g., \u201cAI picks\u201d, \u201cBundle\u201d, \u201cVirtual root\u201d)\n\nA NODE row can declare any type string, so new merchandising ideas are an add data operation, not a change schema project.\n\nUniform traversal: FE code would need special branching logic (first hop to catalog root, then down to category, then maybe jump to a dynamic layer).\n\nEvery element in the tree is a NODE, so the UI just follows parent_node_id from root to leaf without caring what kind of node it meets.\n\nRule & ACL reuse: Separate tables would require duplicate rule engines and permission checks for each table.\n\nA single rule/ACL service attaches to NODEs, so the same logic secures a category, a virtual catalog, or a dynamic \u201cTop Shelf\u201d layer.\n\nVersioning & rollback: With multiple tables, creating a catalog snapshot or rolling back changes means diffing several datasets.\n\nPublishing is simply \u201csnapshot all NODE rows under this catalog_id.\u201d One hash, one rollback step.\n\nFuture AI collections: AI driven layers (\u201cCustomers like you buy\u2026\u201d) don\u2019t map to a classic category/sub category concept.\n\nThey\u2019re stored as NODEs with type=\"aiCollection\" and a resolver reference.

The downside in this approach is that it is rigid and every new layer then either has to become a category or a new object. This can however be a faster path to release.

This path is embedded into the search index and used to power faceted filtering, breadcrumb navigation, and ranking algorithms (e.g. boost or bury logic). It also enables precise analytics on discovery paths and click-through behaviour.\n\nBundles and Solution Sets\n\nNodes with metadata of type bundle or solutionSet support complex packaging models. A bundle node represents a predefined group of products sold as a single unit. A solutionSet node is used to support product configurators and solution-selling, where each child node represents an option group or selectable component (e.g. hardware, software, services).\n\nSchema Resolution at Product Creation\n\nTo resolve the circular dependency between schema inheritance and product filtering, the system decouples schema derivation from the catalogue structure by freezing a product's schema at the time of creation. This ensures that by the time a product is evaluated for inclusion via filters, its schema is complete and immutable.\n\nWorkflow\n\nSelect Base Categories During product creation, the user selects one or more base Nodes (categories) where the product should reside.\n\nMerge Schema Fragments The system traverses the ancestry of all selected base Nodes and aggregates all schema_definition fragments. These are merged into a single schema definition. If conflicts arise (e.g. same field with conflicting types), the process fails with a validation error.\n\nGenerate Merged Schema ID A deterministic key is computed (e.g. using a hash of sorted node IDs and versions) and used to check for an existing merged schema. If one exists, it is reused; otherwise, the merged schema is stored and assigned a new ID.\n\nLink Product to Schema The new product version is permanently linked to the resolved merged_schema_id, which becomes the authoritative schema for that version.\n\nPopulate Attribute Values The user is presented with all fields defined in the merged schema and can populate values as part of the product creation process.\n\nObject Model Evolution\n\nObject Model Evolution\n\nhttps://lucid.app/lucidchart/1fa0e543-c555-4d98-8809-7a9c9be12f63/edit?invitationId=inv_899e17ba-3313-4090-9289-a622d456c39d\\&page=-AHue6fegAec#\n\nAPEX Conversion\n\nAPEX Conversion Thought Process\n\nZuora\u2019s legacy CPQ was delivered as a Salesforce managed package , meaning custom business logic (for pricing, product rules, validations, etc.) was often implemented in Salesforce Apex code. Apex is Salesforce\u2019s proprietary Java like language used to extend platform functionality. These customisations were tightly coupled to Salesforce i.e. they run only inside the Salesforce org and rely on Salesforce data structures (SObjects, SOQL queries, etc.).\n\nNow, we are developing a new CPQ solution outside Salesforce, eliminating the Salesforce dependency. The challenge is migrating the existing Apex based logic to a new environment so that Salesforce is no longer required.\n\nPrinciples and Constraints\n\nKey constraints and goals for this migration include:\n\nNo/Low Code Preferred: Ideally avoid hand writing a large codebase again. A configuration driven or automated solution is desired to reduce maintenance and reliance on specialised Apex developers.\n\nStandalone Abstraction Layer: The solution should be an independent layer (e.g. a service or engine) separate from the CPQ application, so the logic isn\u2019t locked into another monolithic system. This makes it easier to modify or replace in the future without affecting core CPQ.\n\nAWS Preferred: The target runtime should preferably be on AWS (for scalability and familiarity), but open to other platforms as needed.\n\nPreserve Logic 100%: The migrated solution must replicate exactly the same business rules and outcomes as the Apex code.

Quotes configured in the new CPQ should behave identically to the legacy system.\n\nTestable & Deterministic: The new logic layer should be fully unit testable and yield deterministic results (given the same inputs, it produces the same outputs every time, with no hidden state or randomness). This is crucial to validate that the migration was successful and to ensure reliability going forward.\n\nMigrating off Apex is challenging because Apex code cannot run outside Salesforce\u2019s cloud. Apex is executed on Salesforce\u2019s multi-tenant platform (via an interpreter that ultimately runs on a Java VM ), so we need to rehost or rewrite that logic.\n\nChallenges in Converting Apex Logic\n\nBefore diving into solutions, it\u2019s worth noting what makes migrating Apex tricky:\n\nSalesforce Specific APIs: Apex code often uses SOQL (Salesforce\u2019s query language) and references Salesforce objects (e.g., Quote, Account) and fields. These calls must be replaced with equivalent data access in the new system (e.g., via Zuora APIs or a new data model).\n\nData Access: Apex often uses SOQL queries and operates on Salesforce objects. In the new system, the data (products, quotes, etc.) will reside in Zuora\u2019s own database or other microservices. The translated code must call the appropriate APIs or database queries to fetch data.\n\nSalesforce Libraries: Apex has builtin libraries (for example, Math, String methods, etc.) which Java also has, so most will map directly. For sending emails or callouts, we can use standard languages libraries or AWS services (e.g. Amazon SES for emails, or simply have the logic call external HTTP endpoints using Apache HTTPClient or similar).\n\nStateful Context: Salesforce manages the context of the APEX and the component it runs in. All of this needs to be performed by the newly built mechanism.\n\nGovernor Limits and Patterns: Apex code may have been written in a certain way to avoid Salesforce governor limits (bulk-ification patterns, etc.). In a standalone environment, those limits vanish, but the logic might need slight adjustments for efficiency.\n\nTriggers vs Event Handling: In Salesforce, Apex triggers fire on data changes. Outside Salesforce, we may need an event-driven mechanism or explicit service calls from the CPQ app to invoke the logic at the right time (e.g., \u201con quote update, call external logic service\u201d).\n\nTesting Parity: Salesforce required Apex unit tests for deployment; those tests can be repurposed as validation tests for the new solution. Ensuring all those tests pass in the new environment is a good measure of success.\n\nSimulating Component Registration: To preserve a metadata-driven approach, we can implement a plugin registry within our solution.\n\nSolution Options\n\nOption 1: Automated Apex Code Transpilation to AWS Microservices\n\nOne approach is to convert the Apex code into an equivalent in a standard programming language (such as Java or Node.js) and deploy it on AWS as independent services or serverless functions. Apex\u2019s syntax and semantics are very close to Java, making direct translation feasible . In fact, Apex runs on a Salesforce managed Java runtime under the hood, which indicates that conceptually Apex logic can be expressed in Java .\n\nUse a code transpilation tool or process to translate Apex classes into Java classes (or another language of choice). This can be done via open source projects or AI-assisted converters. E.g. - https://github.com/tzmfreedom/apex2java\n\nCan also consider - https://www.codeporting.ai/\n\nHandle Salesforce specific elements during conversion:\n\nReplace SOQL queries with calls to the new CPQ\u2019s API or database queries. This might be semi-automatic: for instance, a query List\\<Account> acc \\= [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE ...]; would need to call the Zuora (or CRM) API to fetch account data instead.\n\nRemove Apex only constructs (like @AuraEnabled annotations triggers context, etc.) or replace them with standard equivalents.\n\nSuch constructs must be known and there can be different constructs that are used across implementations.\n\nDeploy on AWS: The converted code can be packaged as microservices. Options include:\n\nAWS Lambda Functions: Deploy each piece of logic as a Lambda, which the CPQ system can invoke via an API Gateway or direct SDK calls. This is scalable and requires no server management.\n\nContainerised Services: If the logic is complex or needs to maintain",

Options include:\n\nAWS Lambda Functions: Deploy each piece of logic as a Lambda, which the CPQ system can invoke via an API Gateway or direct SDK calls. This is scalable and requires no server management.\n\nContainerised Services: If the logic is complex or needs to maintain state between calls, one could containerise the Java application (e.g., on AWS Fargate or Kubernetes). But most CPQ rules logic should be stateless and suitable for Lambdas.\n\nPreserve and test logic: Because this is essentially the same code just in a new form, it preserves the logic exactly. We would bring over all the conditional logic, calculations, and data manipulations as-is. The migrated code can be validated by running the original Apex unit tests (rewritten in JUnit or another testing framework) to ensure it produces identical outcomes.\n\nApex should already have unit tests.\n\nOption 2: No Code Business Rules Engine on AWS\n\nAnother strategy is to forgo writing code entirely and express the CPQ customisations in a business rules engine or workflow system. Many CPQ customisations boil down to rules: \u201cif certain conditions are met, then take some actions (set a field, add a product, adjust a price, throw an error)\u201d. Instead of hard coding these in Apex or any language, we can use a declarative rules platform where administrators or analysts configure the logic via a UI or configuration files.\n\nChoose a rules engine that can be hosted on AWS. We can consider using ZRules as well.\n\nFor example, OpenRules is a solution where business logic is defined in Excel spreadsheets or tables and then deployed as decision services on AWS (including as AWS Lambda functions or REST endpoints) .\n\nSimilarly, AWS Marketplace offerings or SaaS like DecisionRules.io, Nected, or Decisions provide no-code rule authoring and AWS deployment .\n\nNot ZRules is pretty much based on DecisionRules so that may work.\n\nModel the Apex logic as a set of rules:\n\nEach Apex \u201cif/then\u201d or business check can become a rule condition and an associated action. For instance, an Apex snippet that says \u201cif product X is added and region is Y, then automatically add product Z\u201d would be configured as a rule with condition Product \\== X AND Region \\== Y and action Add Product Z .\n\nCalculations (like setting a discount or price) can be done by rules that compute a value based on inputs (some engines allow formula expressions or script in actions).\n\nValidation logic (\u201cif condition not met, throw error\u201d) becomes a rule that triggers a validation message to the user.\n\nUse the rules engine\u2019s execution platform to run these rules during quoting. For example, a rules engine service could be invoked whenever a quote is being edited or finalised.\n\nThe CPQ system (outside Salesforce) would call the rules engine, pass in the quote data (products, customer info, etc.), and the engine returns any adjustments or errors.\n\nThis is conceptually similar to how Zuora\u2019s legacy CPQ had an internal rules engine for product selection and pricing in Salesforce, except now it\u2019s an external, standalone engine.\n\nMaintain via configuration: Once set up, business users or solution architects can adjust rules via a GUI (or by editing a spreadsheet for OpenRules).\n\nNo Apex or code knowledge is needed. Rules are typically written in a semi natural language or simple condition-action format.\n\nFor example, Subskribe introduced a domain specific rule language (\u201cZeppa\u201d) precisely so that non engineers can configure quote behaviors instead of writing Apex code .\n\nTheir philosophy is that a tailored rules language is a \u201cscalpel\u201d for SaaS quoting logic, whereas Apex was a \u201cblunt hammer\u201d requiring heavy developer involvement .\n\nThese rules can be configured using NLP as well.\n\nTesting and determinism: Each rule or decision table can be tested with sample inputs. Many rule engines allow simulation of rules to see which ones would fire for a given scenario.\n\nWe can reuse scenarios from Apex tests to ensure the rules produce the same outcomes. Because the rules are formally defined, given the same input, the engine will deterministically execute the matching rules.\n\nOption 3: Domain Specific Abstraction Layer (Custom Low-Code DSL)\n\nA third approach is to create a custom abstraction layer, essentially, design your own domain specific language or configuration schema for the CPQ logic, then build a runtime to execute it. This is somewhat a middle ground: instead of using a generic third-party rules engine, you craft a solution tailored exactly to the types of customisations in your legacy Apex. It\u2019s like building a mini rule engine specifically for your needs",

Because the rules are formally defined, given the same input, the engine will deterministically execute the matching rules.\n\nOption 3: Domain Specific Abstraction Layer (Custom Low-Code DSL)\n\nA third approach is to create a custom abstraction layer, essentially, design your own domain specific language or configuration schema for the CPQ logic, then build a runtime to execute it. This is somewhat a middle ground: instead of using a generic third-party rules engine, you craft a solution tailored exactly to the types of customisations in your legacy Apex. It\u2019s like building a mini rule engine specifically for your needs, which can then be used going forward for any new logic as well.\n\nCPQ DSL\n\nCPQ - Domain Specific Language\n\nSep/Oct 2025 Navneet Jain\n\nScope, intent, and alignment 3\n\nAlignment to the mental model 3\n\nLossless core vs best value extras 3\n\nLossless core 3\n\nBest value extras (portable where supported or otherwise degrade/limit gracefully) 4\n\nData Model 4\n\nConcepts and DSL 4\n\nSome High Level Conundrums 4\n\nConfiguration model in one view 4\n\nPackage (Header: Meta, rounding, time, effective dating) 5\n\nPrice Books (which prices, and when) 6\n\nOffers & Components (commercial view over the technical catalogue) 7\n\nAttribute Based Pricing 8\n\nSchedules (ramps, holidays, protection) 9\n\nRules 10\n\nApproval Policies 11\n\nRules & Approvals (Together) (policy, not UI) 12\n\nScenarios & Quotes (options and the priced instance) 12\n\nProposal (buyer snapshot) 13\n\nAgreements (contract container) 14\n\nAgreement & Subscriptions (the contract and what runs) 14\n\nCommitments & Prepayments (with clear scope) 15\n\nPayment Schedules (instalments & milestones) 17\n\nDeal Room (buyer collaboration) 17\n\nAdapters (interoperability contract) 18\n\nEvents (audit trail) 18\n\nTBC 19\n\nComplete Example 19\n\nSchema 27\n\nChallenges, Conundrums, and Open Thought Threads 27\n\nImpedance mismatch between applications and Adapter conundrum 27\n\nSchedule Vs Quote Line Item: Time Slices 27\n\nProposal & Scenarios 28\n\nAppendix 29\n\nWhy Package 29\n\nThis document codifies a JSON first DSL for the CPQ platform.

It intentionally aligns with the general entity models: Quote, QuoteLineItem, Ramp/RampInterval, Approval/ApprovalItem, Scenario, Proposal/QuoteDocument, DealRoom, Extended Schema, OrderActionType etc so the runtime and DSL stay close.\n\nPre Read Notes\n\nThis is for now an aim at V1 and feedback will be considered to evolve it to be a comprehensive DSL.\n\nTerminology is subjective.

But, as you would see, we are not dumping everything into the proposal. Why not dump everything into the proposal? Because proposals are buyer snapshots. The calculation contract (catalogue versions, rules, price books, rounding, timezone) must be decided and then pinned so numbers stay reproducible.\n\nWhere do rounding / timezone live if they rarely change? In practice, they live as defaults at the tenant and customer level, with a clear override hierarchy:\n\nTenantConfig: organisation wide defaults (e.g., rounding, default timezone)\n\nAccountProfile: customer specific overrides (e.g., timezone \u201cAmerica/New_York\u201d, bill cycle preferences)\n\nPackage: versioned commercial artefacts (offers, rules, price books) and defaults only if neither tenant nor account specify them. This is introduced into this piece of work.\n\nEvaluation context (what the engine actually used):\n\nEvery Quote pins pinnedContext (the effective rounding/timezone/priceBook and package versions used).\n\nProposals reference the quote(s). Agreements/Subscriptions inherit the pinned context on execution.\n\nThis keeps customer level behaviour stable while still giving us a versioned package for offers/rules/price books.\n\nPackage (Header: Meta, rounding, time, effective dating) {#package-(header:-meta,-rounding,-time,-effective-dating)}\n\nWhy Introduce Package?\n\nShort answer: Given above. More details here and then in Appendix.\n\nInitially, my thought was to elevate Proposal to the overarching level but then I have decided to introduce a Package/Header concept. The package header (meta, rounding, time, effective dating) is infrastructure for calculation and interoperability, while a proposal is a buyer facing snapshot. If we bury engine wide settings inside the proposal, we lose determinism, portability, and reuse across quotes, scenarios, and agreements. More detailed thought process is in the Appendix.\n\nGenerally such settings are governed by the tenant or customer level configuration. But since we are going to be independent and agnostic of north or south system, capturing such configuration can help us stay independent.\n\n{   \"cpqDsl\": \"1.0\",   \"package\": {     \"id\": \"zcom.myCompany.core\",     \"version\": \"1.3.0\",     \"defaultCurrency\": \"USD\",     \"locale\": \"en-AU\",     \"rounding\": { \"mode\": \"HALF_UP\", \"scale\": 2 },     \"time\": { \"timezone\": \"Australia/Sydney\" }   } }\n\nExample of interplay between tenant config and package:\n\n{   \"tenantConfig\": {     \"rounding\": { \"mode\": \"HALF_UP\", \"scale\": 2 },     \"time\": { \"timezone\": \"UTC\" }   },   \"accountProfiles\": [     {       \"accountRef\": \"acc-789\",       \"rounding\": { \"mode\": \"HALF_UP\", \"scale\": 2 },       \"time\": { \"timezone\": \"America/New_York\" },       \"billing\": { \"defaultBillCycleDay\": 15 }     }   ],   \"cpqDsl\": \"1.0\",  ",

It makes repricing deterministic: historic quotes can be recomputed verbatim. Note that in our catalog Rate Cards are within the charges and associated thereof. Price Books will be an aggregated version of all the rate cards at the catalog level, generated dynamically based on context attributes. Going forward we will refer to this concept as Price Books.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the pricebooks must be versioned and snapshots should be taken so that we can preserve the state of PBs as offered to a customer or a set of customers at a certain time.\n\nOptions: we can consider price book snapshots or the pricebook at a point in time can be generated on the fly based on effective dating in the rate cards. This needs more thinking. Snapshotting provides determinism but it has a cost.\n\nLastly, since we are keeping the offered price book at the proposal level, I believe that we must materialise it and keep a snapshot. Eventually it will be versioned. As such, treating it as a first class concept.\n\n{   \"priceBooks\": [     {       \"id\": \"pb.global.vip.usd.v2025\",       \"currency\": \"USD\",       \"market\": [\"GLOBAL\"],       \"customerType\": [\"VIP\"],       \"effectiveFrom\": \"2025-01-01\",       \"effectiveTo\": null     }   ] }\n\nOffers & Components (commercial view over the technical catalogue) {#offers-&-components-(commercial-view-over-the-technical-catalogue)}\n\nOffers are what sellers choose.

This is facilitated by an Adapter concept, which declaratively lists the capabilities of the target system (e.g., \"minSpend\": true). This ambition aligns with modern architectural trends favoring composable, infrastructure agnostic systems that avoid vendor lock-in.\n\nIt must be acknowledged however that the Adapter model whilst being flexible has vast challenges and must overcome the complexity of achieving meaningful interoperability between mature CPQ platforms. The core challenge is not simply a matter of feature parity but of fundamental impedance mismatch between their underlying data models.\n\nFor instance, the proposed DSL's model flows from Offer to Component to PriceComponent. Salesforce CPQ, in contrast, is architected around a deeply integrated set of objects: a Product can be a Bundle containing Product Options grouped by Product Features, with pricing and configuration logic driven by Price Rules and Product Rules that can execute complex logic, including lookups to other objects. Zuora's model is purpose built for the subscription lifecycle, centered on a Product Catalog of ProductRatePlans and ProductRatePlanCharges, where changes to an active subscription are managed via explicit Order Actions (e.g., New Subscription, Amendment, Renewal).\n\nWhilst I have proposed declarative DSL for Adapter, I do acknowledge that it may require a transformation engine for bringing two heterogeneous applications together.\n\nSchedule Vs Quote Line Item: Time Slices {#schedule-vs-quote-line-item:-time-slices}\n\nThe QuoteLine object can reference multiple schedules via its scheduleRefs array. Now, it can lead to confusion if more than one schedule tries to modify the same field over the same time period. We can restrict QLI \\<> to Schedule to be 1:1 but is that practical?\n\nFor example, a standard three year quantity step up schedule might dictate a quantity of 100 for the first year. A sales user could then apply a separate promotional schedule that offers a quantity of 120 for the first six months as a deal sweetener.\n\nWe probably need to introduce a resolution strategy. Does the last schedule applied win? Are the values summed? Is the maximum value chosen? Is it an error condition that blocks calculation? This could be implemented as a priority field on the schedule reference within the quote line, or an overrideBehavior property (e.g., REPLACE, SUM, MAX) that explicitly declares how colliding values should be handled.\n\nProposal & Scenarios {#proposal-&-scenarios}\n\nWould a proposal with multiple scenarios make sense? From an architectural and commercial clarity standpoint, the answer seems like it should be no.\n\nA Proposal represents a specific, actionable, and often legally binding offer. Including multiple scenarios within a single proposal introduces ambiguity. Which option is the customer accepting? How are totals calculated? A cleaner architectural pattern will be to maintain the Proposal as a representation of a single Scenario and its associated Quote(s).\n\nTo present options to a buyer, the DealRoom concept can be leveraged, or a new ScenarioComparison (too much I guess) object could be introduced. This object would present multiple scenarios, and an action taken on one of them (e.g., \"Select Option A\") would then generate a distinct Proposal for that single, chosen scenario. This maintains a clean 1:1 relationship between a formal proposal and the specific commercial terms it represents.\n\nAppendix {#appendix}\n\nWhy Package {#why-package}\n\nDeterministic maths & audit Rounding mode, precision, timezone, and price book or catalog /version are part of the calculation contract. They must be pinned before a quote/proposal is produced so the same inputs always recompute to the same outputs (today and two years from now). The proposal in this model holds buyer totals (ARR/MRR/TCB/TCV) but not the engine contract (rounding/timezone/price book), so we can\u2019t reliably re-price a historic proposal without a separate package header.\n\nReuse across scenarios/quotes One package (catalogue, rules, approvals, price book/rate cards) powers many scenarios and quotes. Several of those may become proposals, others won\u2019t. Keeping",

Several of those may become proposals, others won\u2019t. Keeping the meta on the package prevents drift and duplicate settings scattered across multiple proposals. Our data model already separates Scenario, Quote and Proposal for this reason.\n\nEffective dating (Rate Cards/ Price Books) Which list prices apply is a function of rate cards/ pricebook with dates, not of a single proposal. If \u201cwhat\u2019s current\u201d is embedded in a proposal, we can\u2019t cleanly compare scenarios, nor can we amend/renew with the correct vintage.\n\nPinning priceBookRef at the package, then recording it in the quote\u2019s pinnedVersions, solves this. We have Price/Rate Plan/Charge, ramps and renewal/term objects, but not a single place to pin the effective rate/card price book for recompute.\n\nInteroperability (adapters) Cross system parity (Zuora Orders, Salesforce CPQ, etc.) depends on adapter capabilities and mapping rules that are global to the package, not specific to a proposal. Adapters cannot be held hostage to internal concepts of the engine.\n\nPerformance & governance Engines cache/catalogue by package id/version, not by proposal. Rules and approvals (who, when, SLA) are policy and hence they shouldn\u2019t be replicated per proposal. A package acts like \u201ccode\u201d: it\u2019s reviewed once, versioned, then referenced by many proposals: clean change control. Our Workflow/Approval objects fit this pattern.\n\nLifecycle separation Proposal is a publishable artifact (doc set + clauses) that a buyer sees. Package is the spec to produce that artifact. Our Proposal object has baseCurrency, status, documents and totals with Quote/QuoteLine/Ramp living below it and Agreement/Subscription live after acceptance. Keeping engine meta at package level keeps those transitions clean.\n\nWhat goes where (rule of thumb):\n\nPackage (engine contract): rounding mode/scale, timezone, rate card/pricebook/effective dates, adapter capabilities/mappings, global rules & approvals.\n\nQuote/Scenario (commercial config): term, lines, overrides, schedules, and pinnedVersions back to the package.\n\nProposal (buyer snapshot): selected scenario/quotes, documents/clauses, presented totals, expiry.\n\nAgreement/Subscription (execution): what actually runs post signature (terms, bill cycle, commitments).",

This is the \"boiler room of the ship\" - where real platform capability emerges.\n\nKey Strategic Insight:\n\n\"The intersection is everything underneath. That's where I need to be able to go and influence people.\"\n\nNav sees a critical 6-month window to make a \"big splash\" before market consolidation makes it harder. He's been advocating for moving \"from middle to front\" for 4+ years and sees this as Zuora's last best chance.\n\nCore Strategic Themes\n\n1. The Intersection Architecture: Five-Layer Model\n\nNav describes the architectural vision using a whiteboard model with five distinct layers:\n\nLayer 1: Interactions Layer (Top)\n\nCustomer-facing touchpoints\n\nWhere users actually engage with the system\n\nMultiple channels (web, mobile, embedded, API)\n\nLayer 2: Context Man",

    "content": "you are, where you're coming from, what you're trying to do\n\nLifecycle awareness, behavioral understanding\n\nThis is the intelligence layer that makes omni-channel work\n\nLayer 3: Intelligent Commerce Orchestrator\n\nExecutes flows and journeys\n\nCoordinates actions across the system\n\nThe conductor that makes everything work together\n\nLayer 4: Actions Layer\n\nDiscrete capabilities that can be composed\n\nExamples: price calculation, discount application, bundle creation\n\nReusable across different flows\n\nLayer 5: Platform Services (Bottom)\n\nFoundational services consumed by everything above\n\nPricing engine, rules engine, catalog service, etc.\n\n\"The boiler room\" - where the real value is created\n\nCritical Quote:\n\n\"The intersection is the boiler room of the ship, right? I think that's it. I don't know what the analogy. I know about the Titanic. I don't know anything else. It's the boiler room. That's where the power is, right?\"\n\nWhy This Matters: Most companies think platform value is in the user interface. Nav knows it's in the foundational services - the boiler room that powers everything.\n\n2. Pricing and Rating: Critical Separation\n\nCurrent State Problem:\n\n\"Pricing and rating are tightly coupled in billing... All the models are loaded in there, and then the algorithms to multiply when the usage comes.\"\n\nWhy This Is Broken:\n\nThe Order Preview Disaster: When catalog or commerce needs to preview a price:\n\nMust call billing's \"order preview\" API\n\nBilling loads entire subscription history\n\nExecutes rating engine unnecessarily\n\n\"Order preview is one of the worst calls... the older the subscription, more the changes it has gone through, heavier it becomes\"\n\nYou're calling an entire billing engine just to get a price preview.\n\nThe Architectural Solution:\n\nPricing Engine (Monetization Models):\n\nProduct pricing definitions\n\nPlan structures\n\nMonetization models\n\nShould live in catalog/commerce layer\n\nLightweight, fast, stateless\n\nRating Engine (Usage Multiplication):\n\nUsage-based calculations\n\nComplex metering\n\nConsumption tracking\n\nStays in billing where it belongs\n\nHeavy, stateful, transaction-based\n\nWhy Separate:\n\nPricing decisions don't need rating complexity\n\nCommerce flows don",

    "content": "t need billing's historical state\n\nPerformance: lightweight pricing vs heavy rating\n\nArchitecture: different concerns, different layers\n\nImplementation:\n\n\"When you define your product or a plan pricing, you should go in there, because the monetization model sit in there.\"\n\nPricing should be a platform service consumed by catalog, CPQ, commerce, billing - not locked in billing.\n\n3. Rules Engine and Constraints: More Than Just Pricing\n\nNav's Requirement for Documentation:\n\n\"In an Excel sheet in plain English, write the rules, top 100 rules, or top 50 or top three rules that you will configure, because I don't want to be facing my blind spots after I'm done.\"\n\nWhat Nav Needs: Not PRDs or FRDs - just a list of actual business rules that need to be executed:\n\nEligibility rules (who can buy what)\n\nConstraint rules (what can't be combined)\n\nPricing rules (how to calculate)\n\nDiscount rules (when to apply)\n\nApproval rules (who must approve)\n\nEntitlement rules (what access is granted)\n\nKey Architectural Decision:\n\n\"Rule engine will be doing the job of pricing engine.\"\n\nThe rules engine is broader than pricing - pricing is one type of rule among many.\n\nTony's Important Point:\n\n\"Tony made a very good point. Let's not call it a rules engine. It's maybe more than that... We need to give it another name.\"\n\nWhy Names Matter: \"Rules engine\" sounds technical and narrow. This is actually a commerce intelligence engine that:\n\nMakes pricing decisions\n\nEnforces business constraints\n\nValidates configurations\n\nApplies discounts and promotions\n\nManages entitlements\n\nExecutes eligibility checks\n\nBetter Names to Consider:\n\nCommerce Intelligence Engine\n\nBusiness Logic Service\n\nDecision Engine\n\nCommerce Brain\n\nMonetization Service\n\n4. Actions and Orchestration: The Relationship\n\nNav's Explanation:\n\n\"Actions are more than the rules. However, an action can be dependent upon a rule... I won't buy something, but in the flow of purchase, I selected some products. Now as part of the flow, I need to make sure some rules are executed.\"\n\nThe Hierarchy:\n\nActions (Discrete Capabilities):\n\nCalculate price\n\nApply discount\n\nCreate bundle\n\nValidate configuration\n\nGenerate quote\n\nProcess payment\n\nRules (Decision Logic):\n\nCan be independent\n\nCan be part of an action\n\nExecute within action context\n\nOrchestration (Flow Coordination):\n\nBunch of actions come together\n\nSequence matters\n\nContext flows through\n\n\"That's orchestration\"\n\nExample Flow:\n\nCustomer adds product to cart (ACTION)\n  \u039f\u0394\u03b2\u00c4\u2020' Check eligibility rules (RULE within action)\n  \u039f\u0394\u03b2\u00c4\u2020' Calculate base price (ACTION)\n  \u039f\u0394\u03b2\u00c4\u2020' Apply discount rules (RULE within action)\n  \u039f\u0394\u03b2\u00c4\u2020' Validate bundle constraints (RULE)\n  \u039f\u0394\u03b2\u00c4\u2020' Generate quote (ACTION)\n\nORCHESTRATION coordinates all of this\nCONTEXT SERVICE provides who/what/where information\nRULES ENGINE executes business logic\nACTIONS LAYER provides discrete capabilities\n\nThe Architecture:\n\n\u039f\u0394\"\u2248\u00a3\u039f\u0394\"\u03b2\u00b2\u00a7\u039f\u0394\"\u03b2\u00b2\u00a7\u039f\u0394\"\u03b2\u00b2\u00a7\u039f\u0394\"\u03b2\u00b2\u00a7\u039f\u0394\"\u03b2\u00b2\u00a7\u039f\u0394\"\u03b2\u00b2\u00a7\u039f\u0394\"\u03b2\u00b2\u00a7\u039f\u0394",

(Problem Statement)\n\nScalability issues initially drove the idea to rebuild Zuora CPQ on its own modern Zuora platform, as the current native on Salesforce-built Zuora CPQ cannot handle more than 100 quote lines in an efficient way.   Scalability requirements of many of Zuora\u2019s enterprise customers were a main consideration.  This decision was confirmed, seeing that most CPQs that claim integration with Salesforce CRM are not native to Salesforce.  The most famous converts from being native built on Salesforce to a solution built on their own platform are Conga (Apttus CPQ) and Salesforce CPQ.  Overall, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of being a native to the SFDC ISV app.\n\nAnalysis results: \u2018Next Gen CPQ for P&T Leadership\u2019      \n\n1.3 Who is it for?

She has two main objectives for the quote\u2026 first, she wants to pitch the price correctly; this is usually a tradeoff between getting a low enough price that the quote is attractive to the buyer versus adhering to pricing constraints; the sales person is often less concerned about commission, as a factor in pricing, due to the \u201cone in the hand is worth two in the bush\u201d mentality. The second large concern for her is the professionalism of the quote - they want to get a quote out quickly, which accurately covers the buyer key stakeholders' requirements, and they don\u2019t want to expose internal bureaucracy in the form of unintuitive line-items, duplication, etc.\nNatalie is approximately 40 years old and grew up with computers. In contrast to some of her older coworkers, who are about to retire soon, she has no negative perception of their sales systems.  For her older coworkers, the systems are perceived as an impediment to sales, as they consume valuable time that could be better spent with customers on the phone or on-site.  Natalie views their sales systems as a source of information about existing customers that helps to shape deals she puts in front of her prospects.\nEarly in the deal, Natalie likes to present different quote versions to the prospect to gauge their interest.  Those quote versions differ in many aspects, such as products and quantities, their positioning, and key parameters about pricing. However, they do not yet have any discounts (they are budget quotes).  They help to get a better sense of the prospect's budget and their willingness to work with her.  She believes the more a customer is engaged with her, specifically at the beginning of the deal, the less time they spend with her competition, and she can influence the deal and the prospect to her advantage.\n\nDeal Desk Admin\n\nTitle:\nSenior Deal Desk Analyst\n\nCompa",

This means they will want to protect margins, adhere to regulations (ASC606, etc), and keep the company's pricing policies consistent. A common tactic is to introduce friction for less attractive deals - i.e., you need more approvals for higher discounts.

He is very knowledgeable, and he can help Natalie with alternative ideas on what and how to position a deal, so the race to the lowest price point can be avoided.\n\nApprovers. As constraining rules are applied to pricing, the common practice is to assign deal approvers to different scenarios: these may be FLMs, for slightly exceptional discounts, Deal Desk, for larger exceptions, or product line-specific approvers, such as a product\u2019s GM. In some cases, these approvers are there to ask pointed questions but are unlikely, in practice, to fundamentally block a deal if it is feasible to close. Therefore, the approver\u2019s diligence, timeliness, and redundancy in the system greatly impact the degree of friction in the CPQ process, which may not be proportionate to the exceptionality of the deal.\n\nSolution Manager\n\nTitle:\nSr. Sales Engineer\n\nCompany:\nMatrix Corp\n\nKey Responsibilities:\nA solution manager bridges the gap between customer needs and the company's offerings, ensuring the right solutions are presented and implemented.

This is important for architectural decisions as CPQ intersects with th product and bundle definition that will be introduced to the Unified Zuora Catalog.  Since CPQ requires these new product types some relationships need to be highlighted.\nFirst hard and dynamic bundling in almost all industries means that many component products are assigned to a parent product and not that many charge items are assigned to a product (bundling of products and not bundling of charge items).\n\nSecond, ifa  company adipting the use of configurable products (= dynamic bundles), then a hard bundle can be derived form a configurable product.  This is also understood in many industries as a pre-configured product.  Pre-configured products of a configurable product",

This allows Zuora customers to expose the product/plan configurator to other systems.\n\nSolution Configurator End User\n\nA solution configuration is similar to a product configuration.  In addition to a product configuration in solutions, multiple individual products can be combined by the user to form a solution.  The example of a hospital bed solution where a hospital is looking to build out numerous different wards like maternity, ICU, and a pediatric ward with varying types of beds and related products is a good example.  Zuora currently has customers like Xylem, NCR Atlios, NCR Voyix, and Nutanix, to name only a few, that would like to combine different products into solutions they also offer individually in order to solve customer-specific requirements.  Many top CPQ solution providers offer a solution configuration capability to cater to larger enterprises that have a large assortment of products and services.\n\nThere is an overlap between product rules that can be enforced at the quote level and solution configurations.  Applying solution configuration rules to a set of products is preferred to applying product rules to the content of a quote or shopping cart.  Why?  A cart or a quote might just hold a set of products that might or might not have a relationship.  For a solution, it can always be assumed that the products in the solution have relationships.  A user who wants to enforce relationships to all or a subset of products in a cart or quote can and should always create a solution if they want to enforce such product relationships.  If not, then they add products to the cart or quote without the context of a solution.\n\nAlso, it is not perfect, but here are some product rule examples that govern checks and completeness in a solution of a quote. \n\nQuote Rules Example for POC\n\nID Requirement Priority MVP Notes 40.10 Sales Rep shall be able to indicate that a new solution configuration will be started in Z-CPQ system 2 yes Sales reps need the ability to explicitly initiate a solution configuration.

The basics for this admin are the products as maintained in the Zuora Commerce Catalog.  The rules that govern and produce the product configuration output are also managed in this Zuora-provided admin.  Resources that manage configuration models can be administrators belonging to IT, sales ops, pricing, or even product management.  Good configuration administrations do not require users to write rules, and they make it easy to create models and keep them up to date over time.\n\nSolution Configuration product relationships can also be maintained in the area and with the same rule editor as Product Configuration model rules.

Many needs are not known at the beginning of a deal, and hence, sales reps cannot be bothered to make a complete, detailed quote at that stage.  Besides the effort that is necessary to produce a quote, the information needed is often not known or needed.  Ideally, after price guidance has been generated, the sales rep can slowly fill in the blanks and arrive at a full-fledged, detailed quote.  A soft transition from a budget idea for the customer to a concrete proposal would be ideal.  The input into price guidance might be provided by sales reps as a prompt.  The system then generates the price guidance with AI.  In preparation for building such price guidance, administrators might create a set of preconfigurations for each configurable product, which the AI can then pull into price guidance based on requirements written in the prompt.  As such, preconfigurations have a price, and by using multiple preconfigurations on a quote line, the price guidance can then generate the suggested range.\n\nID Requirement Priority MVP Notes 60.10 Sales Rep shall be able to create a Price Guidance in Z-CPQ system 1 yes The sales rep adds prospect/customer information to the system. He also added a description of what he understood the customer needed. The system proposes a high-level sketch of quote content.

The sales rep can download and use it in his presentation, email, and deal room for this prospect. 60.30 Sales Rep shall be able to customer Research in Z-CPQ system 3 yes Sales reps can, for existing customers, understand important metrics that will help them to finalize an amendment and renewal with up/down/cross-sell.

He can select various quotes as starting points.\n\nQuote Sales Rep Experience\n\nAt the core of the Next Gen CPQ is the sales rep.  He is the primary user of the new application.  The main interaction for sales reps is the quote line page.  That\u2019s where adding products and manipulating prices is at the center of their interaction with CPQ.

    "content": " Deal Engine (the name of this function might change based on marketing decision).  The deal engine is an integral part of the quote line page, where sales reps manipulate the prices and quantities of quote lines representing QPRCs (Quote Line Charge Items).  There are various strategies a sales rep can pursue besides lowering the price to make a deal more attractive to the customer.  They can ramp a deal so customers' usage can adjust over time and is sized according to the customer's needs.  A sales rep can upsell the customer to a better solution, allowing for deeper discounts without going into approvals.  For example, proposing a longer-term commitment and pointing out to the customer the overall savings compared to a shorter-term agreement.  Applying these various strategies and getting them right from a value perspective while also thinking about presenting those to the customer in the correct way is challenging for sales reps.  This challenge is compounded if the sales rep is building a rather large quote for an enterprise agreement with many line items.  Up to 50-500 QRPS quote lines are not unusual for Zuora customers, and a lack of efficiency in dealing with such larger quotes forces Zuora customers to use spreadsheets to manipulate the quote lines before they move into the Quote application.  An example is Celonis, where sales reps create the quote outside of the current Zuora CPQ and then enter the result into the Zuora CPQ system at the end.  This diminishes the value of the system and does not make it sticky with the customer.  Deal Engine must be a function that is a delight for sales reps to use, as they feel that it is easy to use and gets them the results they need.  \n\nID Requirement Priority MVP Notes 80.10 System shall show in Z-CPQ TCB, TCV, MRR, ARR from Z-Metrics aaS 1 yes Sales reps need basic metric data. 80.20 System shall show in Z-CPQ a derived or calculated Deal Score from Z-Metrics aaS 3 yes The deal score is dependent on many factors, e.g., vertical, region, size of the deal, customer size, deal size, margins, products sold, etc. 80.30 System shall show in Z-CPQ a high-risk and a low-risk indicator from Z-Metrics aaS 4 yes This is similar to a deal score, but this indicator only focuses on the potential risk (to deliver on time, to run into legal issues, to collect payments from customers, etc.) for the company.

Another key advantage is the ability to post-marketing and supplemental information that supports the prospect in making a decision.  A Deal Room conveys a higher degree of professionalism and allows for more flexibility in quote proposal presentation and interaction levels with the prospect.

Sales reps might decide to add marketing content to be published. 100.30 System shall send notification via email with a link to the Deal Room to the Account sold-to Contact in Z-CPQ system 2 yes The sold-to contact will receive an email with a link to the secure Deal Room. 100.40 Customer Buyer shall be able to allow account sold-to contact to access the Deal Room in Z-CPQ system 2 yes Allow the contact to view the Deal Room content. Not every sold-to contact is allowed to sign the agreement. Let's say the contact is from the IT department w/o procurement permission. In order to sign the deal, the IT person has to invite one or multiple people from the procurement and finance departments to sign the deal. 100.50 System shall display the quote proposal in deal room in Z-CPQ system 2 yes The system displays the proposal as generated by the sales rep from the quote to the customer contact. 100.60 Customer Buyer shall be able to compare various quote alternatives in Z-CPQ system 2 yes Allow prospect user to compare two (or more) quote versions to understand how they differ in their key metrics. 100.70 System shall display related marketing materials about products and company in Z-CPQ system 4 yes The sales rep might decide to add marketing-related content (Product Datasheets, Whitepapers, etc) to be available for the contact to view in the Deal Room. 100.80 Customer Buyer procurement shall be able to allow contact to comment on a quote proposal in Z-CPQ system 2 yes Contact can place comments on the quote lines of the proposal 100.90 Customer Buyer shall be able to allow contact to deselect products from quote proposal in Z-CPQ system 3 yes Contact can remove products from the quote, marking them as not applicable.

The system sends a confirmation email with an order acknowledgment form.\n\nQuote Deal Desk\n\nDeal desk personnel are the company's authority in structuring a deal and getting exceptions approved.  As they are power users in the system, they need a few additional special functions compared to sales reps.  The real value of a deal desk function and the deal desk-specific UI is the quick understanding of the quote parameters, like quote metrics, and the reasons why the system flagged a quote with an exception.  They need to be able to drill from the general quote level metrics to the most specific quote line item level in an easy way.  Often, the deal desk is allowed to override certain quote rules to \u2018make a deal happen.\u2019  As companies restrict their sales reps to follow strict company rules and policies, deals desk personnel can make exceptions and, if needed, override company policies.   Having said that, in most cases, the deal desk sends a quote back to the sales rep with requests for changes to stay within given margins and soft policies.  Soft policies are rules a company has established that are not enforced in the CPQ system.  For those soft policies, rules do not exist in the CPQ system, but are known to sales reps and the deal desk, who manually check if they are adhered to.\n\nID Requirement Priority MVP Notes 110.10 System shall provide task list for rule-based flagged quotes in Z-Workflow 2 yes Users can easily create another alternate quote from an existing quote.

If possible, users can mention them, and the system sends an alert email to the mentioned user. 110.40 Deal Desk admin shall be able to view Deal Score in Z-CPQ system 2 yes Users can request approval and review from another user who is not part of the approval workflow. 110.50 Deal Desk admin shall be able to capture internal notes in Z-CPQ system 3 yes The user approves or rejects a quote after review. This is a typical workflow action. A rejection will send the quote back to the sales rep; an approval will route the quote to the next approver. 110.60 Deal Desk admin shall be able to request ad-hoc approval in Z-CPQ system 4 yes Users can request approval and review from another user who is not part of the approval workflow 110.70 Deal Desk admin shall be able to accept and reject quote in Z-CPQ system 2 yes User approves or rejects a quote after review. This is a typical workflow action. A rejection will send the quote back to the sales rep, an approval will route the quote to the next approver. 110.80 Deal Desk admin shall be able to override certain quote rules in Z-CPQ system 3 yes There are certain business policies that are enforced by quote rules. A deal desk person shall be able to override those rules and make changes to a quote. This override function shall only be possible for designated rules.\n\nApproval Workflow\n\nApproval workflows are managing the collaboration between various actors who have a stake in the quote.  The sales rep will always initiate an approval workflow.  In most cases, business rules and an HR reporting hierarchy govern the approval sequence.  However, using the HR hierarchy is not a necessity to determine the approval sequence,",

The most typical interaction a user has with a workflow task is the approval or rejection of a quote, but it might not be limited to just an approval versus rejection action.  An ad-hoc workflow task is very valuable as it allows users like sales reps and customer buyer contacts to include ad-hoc other people in their organization to contribute to the quote.  The simplest form of contribution is to comment at the quote or line item level.  Comments can provide direction for the sales rep and customer buyer to make changes to the quote or quote proposal.

Workflows are triggered by quote field content.\n\nDirect - Quote Request Flow\n\nZuora must enable self-service sales and quote request scenarios as part of the Omnichannel story.  Typically, prospects like to conduct research on possible products, services, and solutions before they contact specific solution providers.  In most cases, if the solutions are of higher complexity or the deals are large in nature, prospects want to engage with a sales rep.  Of course, transitioning from a self-service buying to an assisted sale scenario is ripe for agentic AI, and Zuora shall also consider how to handle incoming quote requests on an AI-driven automated basis.  The majority of incoming requests will be about price and, secondly, inquiries if a product supports a specific use case the customer has.   \n\nFrom an interaction point of view, self-service prospects might not be registered users in the Zuora CPQ system.  \n\nFrom a UI point of view, many of the UIs used for quoting can be reused.  For example, the entire catalog search, configuration, and selection experience can be reused.  Since many of the Zuora customers already have commerce portals deployed, it is unlikely that they will just use the Zuora-provided eCommerce applications.  \n\nThe likely scenarios of how the Zuora catalog is used with existing Customer e-commerce portals are as follows:\n\nZuora customers will digest products and prices via export from Zuora and import into their e-commerce systems.  Biz logic and UI are rendered in the Customer e-commerce system.\n\nZuora customers will use Zuora public Catalog APIs to retrieve product and price information. Biz logic and UI are rendered in the Customer e-commerce system.\n\nZuora customers will use Zuora public CPQ APIs and UI to provide a product configuration experience.  Solution configuration experiences are most likely not supported in a self-service scenario; hence, a lower-priority\n\nZuora customers will use their own shopping cart and check-out functionality. Hence, the focus is not on those areas for the CPQ MVP, and some basic shopping carts are needed for demos.\n\nID Requirement Priority MVP Notes 150.10 System shall access a self-service portal (sample implementation) 3 yes A portal for self-service users. This is usually provided by an existing eCommerce system deployed by and owned by Zuora customers.

This shall not be implemented for Zuora CPQ MVP.\n\nIndirect - SPR\n\nThe indirect sales process will focus on the high-tech 2-tier distribution channel.  This is the most relevant channel for Zuora's existing customers and, hence, has already been requested by Zoom and ??? to be supported by the current Zuora CPQ solution.\n\nThere are a variety of processes that a system can support in regard to selling partner channel management. Still, Zuora will stay focused on the transactional aspect of partner channel management.  In other words, Zuora is not planning to build functionality to manage selling partner relationships, which is typical for PRM solutions.\n\nThe next-gen CPQ solution will enable the publishing of products and prices to disti portals.  This allows distis to provide a catalog search, select and add products to a quote that is provided and managed in a disit provided quoting system.  It is not expected that distis will use Zuora CPQ UI to facilitate a quoting experience for VAR sales reps who are quoting on their portal.  \n\nThat is the reason why some requirements state that they are only sample implementations used to demo the functionality of the process and Zuora public APIs that facilitate only a part of the quoting process.\n\nA major transactional process that is in scope is the support for distis to make Special Pricing Requests (SPRs).  SPRs are almost identical to a quote request, but they focus on the aspect of pricing (request higher discounts to better compete in deals) and not as much on what products are quoted.  Rounding up the SPR process is the ability to place an order for a service in Zuora.\n\nAnother major aspect is the support for marketplaces that are sponsored and provided by a large high-tech distributor such as Ingram Micro and Arrow.  These marketplaces offer a large product catalog with products from all vendors (=Zuora CPQ customers). The disti has a rel",

Now, the unique aspect of a marketplace is the ability to provide products via vendor-provided APIs, eliminating the need to import product prices and a lot of SKUs for a valid configuration of configurable products.

That\u2019s why there are specific requirements in this PRD for supporting catalog experience (getting prices for SKUs) and product configuration experience via productized APIs.\n\nID Requirement Priority MVP Notes 160.10 Partner Sales Rep shall access a disti portal (sample implementation) in Partner Portal 4 no A portal for VAR sales reps (2nd tier) provided by the distributor (1st tier).

The purpose is to show how a VAR sales rep can create a quote for configurable products and solutions with ramps. Also, quotes for renewals and amendments can be in scope. 160.40 Sales Rep shall send quote with SPR# via email in Partner Portal 3 yes A disti sales rep will create for the VAR quote an SPR. The VAR sales rep cannot win the deal unless the Zuora customer provides higher discounts to the disti. The UI to create the SPR is only a sample implementation using public Zuora CPQ APIs, as the Zuora CPQ UI will not be used by disti portals.

The channel rep is checking if the deal is registered by the disti sales rep. The channel rep gets the approvals for the higher discount, similar to a quote, and sends the SPR back to the disti rep with a SPR approval number. 161.60 Sales Ops Admin shall enable Product/Plan/Price Export in Partner Portal 3 yes After the channel rep sends back the approved SPR, the disti sales rep can place an order. The order must have the SPR # as a reference to get the agreed favorable price as requested via the SPR. Normally, placing an order with suppliers is done from the disti procurement system. Hence, this is just the ability to receive an order request from the disti. 162.70 System shall in Partner Portal 3 yes A channel ops person generates exports of products and prices that can be imported into a disti portal.

This challenge mainly arises from its deep integration with the Zuora billing system and its design to handle the complexities of Subscription Lifecycle Management. In support of the architecture work, which aims to take a fresh look at the challenges, this document will provide guidance on the high-priority functional requirements that the new architecture must meet. The product manager emphasizes the need for an architectural solution that directly tackles these complexities, enabling future performance and scalability, functional completeness for high- and medium-priority features, and ease of use.

The company has raised $11M in total funding with their last known round in May 2021, and they are experiencing difficulty finding product-market fit as evidenced by multiple strategic pivots. The departure of both co-founders (Yang Zhang to Anthropic, Chung Wu to Databricks) and their ongoing struggle to establish a clear GTM motion further elevate this concern. Should Plasmic cease operations, Zuora could face disruption to product roadmap, loss of enhancements and bug fixes, and potential support burden.\n\nMitigation: Our 5-year source code rights provide a critical safety net, enabling Zuora to fork and maintain the codebase independently if needed. Additionally, the core platform's AGPL open-source license allows us to continue using and developing the technology without commercial restrictions as a fallback position. Our technical architecture explicitly isolates the Plasmic layer, making it feasible to transition to an alternative solution or maintain the platform internally with our engineering team.

The same product can appear in as many packages as you want.\n\n**Q: How do discounts work in packages?** You can set package-level discounts that apply to the bundle price, or individual product discounts within the package.\n\n**Q: Can customers modify a package after purchase?** Yes, if you allow it. You control whether packages are fixed or customizable after purchase.\n\n**Q: Do bundles affect billing?** Bundles are merchandising constructs.

When a rule changes, it should update everywhere automatically.\n\n**Example:** \"All annual subscriptions get 20% off\" or \"Trial period is 14 days\"\n\n### Optimization Strategy **What it is:** Decisions about which offers to show to which customers, when, and how.\n\n**Why it matters:** Different customers respond to different offers.

For example, \"Customer Type\" rules might override \"Location\" rules. BCS resolves conflicts based on your priorities.\n\n**Q: Can context be used for things other than pricing and catalog?** Yes. Any system that needs to understand customer context can use BCS - promotions, content personalization, user experience, recommendations, etc.\n\n**Q: How do we migrate existing rules into BCS?** We provide migration tools to convert existing location/segment/channel rules into BCS context rules.\n\n---\n\n## What's Not Changing\n\nYour existing products and catalogs stay as they are - Current pricing and promotional rules continue to work - Existing customer data and subscriptions are unaffected - How customers browse and purchase remains the same\n\n**What we're adding:** A layer that makes all these systems smarter about context and eliminates manual configuration.\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nWe'll know this is successful when: - Time to launch location-specific pricing drops from weeks to minutes -",

Customers see the wrong offers. Sales teams can't quickly create custom packages.\n\n**Real example**: A company wants to offer 20% off annual plans in Germany. Today, this requires updating five different systems and takes two weeks. By then, the competitive moment is gone.\n\n### What We're Building Three connected capabilities that work together:\n\n1. **Smart Context Detection** - Automatically figures out who each customer is, where they are, and what they need 2. **Flexible Product Management** - Easy tools to create bundles, packages, and pricing that work across all channels 3. **Seamless Buying Experience** - Let customers discover, compare, configure, and buy\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0412\u043c\u0442\u0410\u042dwithout talking to a sales rep\n\n### Business Impact - **Time savings**: What takes weeks happens in minutes - **Revenue growth**: Right offers to right customers \\= higher conversion - **Market expansion**: Launch in new regions and channels faster - **Competitive advantage**: Do things Salesforce and Stripe can't\n\n### Investment Needed - **Phase 1** (Q1 2025): Foundation work with existing team + 2 additional engineers - **Phase 2** (Q2 2025): Scale capabilities with +10 team members - **Phase 3** (Q3 2025): Complete solution with +8 team members\n\n**Expected return**: $86M revenue in Year 1, growing to $335M by Year 3\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters Now\n\n### What Customers Tell Us\n\n**GM OnStar** (In-vehicle subscriptions): > \"We launch new features every month, but creating the right bundles and pricing for different cu",

We need something in between.\"\n\n### The Market Reality\n\n**87% of buyers** expect personalized experiences, but only 23% of companies can deliver them consistently.\n\n**58% of CEOs** are launching new business models and product lines, but their commerce systems can't keep up.\n\n**76% of enterprises** plan to launch in new markets or channels in the next 18 months, but setup takes too long.\n\n**The pattern**: Everyone needs to move faster and personalize more, but existing tools make this hard or impossible.\n\n### Competitive Threat\n\n**Salesforce** is rebuilding their entire commerce platform and will launch in 2025. They're marketing it as \"complete revenue platform for subscriptions.\"\n\n**Stripe** continues making their simple model work for more complex scenarios. They're winning the \"easy\" segment we should own.\n\n**If we don't act**: We lose deals to Salesforce at the high end and Stripe at the low end. We become just a billing engine.\n\n**If we execute well**: We own the category of \"Total Monetization\" - the only platform that handles truly complex subscription commerce.\n\n---\n\n## What We're Building\n\n### The Big Picture\n\nThink of three layers that work together:\n\n``` \u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u253c\u0422\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442\u0410\u042d\u0442\u0412\u043c\u251c\u0432\u0442",

```\n\nEach layer builds on the one below. Each can be sold separately, but together they're more powerful.\n\n### Capability 1: Smart Context Detection\n\n**What it does**: Automatically figures out who the customer is and what they should see.\n\n**The problem it solves**: Today, if you sell in multiple countries with different pricing, you need to: - Manually configure pricing for each location - Update multiple systems when anything changes - Hope everything stays in sync\n\n**How our solution works**: 1. Customer visits your website from Germany 2. System automatically detects: Location \\= Germany, Channel \\= Website, Customer Type \\= New Visitor 3. System applies: Euro pricing, German terms, appropriate product catalog 4. Customer sees the right offer instantly\n\n**Real example - Healthcare Company**: - **Before**: Must charge 10% premium for HIPAA-compliant storage. This requires manually updating pricing across four systems. Takes days. Easy to make mistakes. - **After**: Set rule once: \"If Healthcare customer, add 10%\". Applies automatically. Updates everywhere instantly.\n\n**Why this matters**: - Set up new regions in minutes instead of weeks - Never show wrong prices to customers - Change strategy instantly (raise prices, run promotions, launch bundles)\n\n### Capability 2: Flexible Product Management\n\n**What it does**: Easy tools to create bundles, packages, tiered offerings, and promotions.\n\n**The problem it solves**: Today, creating a bundle like \"Professional Package \\= Software + Support + Training\" requires: - Custom coding - Separate setup in each system - Hard to change once created - Difficult to show relationships between products\n\n**How our solution works**:\n\n**Packages** - Pre-built combinations: - Create \"Startup Bundle\" \\= Product A + Product B + Support - Set package price (can be different from individual prices) - Add package-level discount - Done - available everywhere automatically\n\n**Bundles** - Customer choice: - Create \"Pick 3 Channels\" from 10 available options - Set rules: minimum 2, maximum 5 - Price each option differently - Let customers build their own plan\n\n**Features** - Building blocks: - Define what features exist (Lock/Unlock, Super Cruise, Premium Support) - Attach pricing to features - Combine features into products flexibly\n\n**Real example - GM OnStar**: - **Before**: Every new feature requires creating new product in system. Want to bundle \"Super Cruise + Security + Apps\"? Requires engineering work to connect them. - **After**: Define bundle rules: \"Super Cruise only available with Premium package\". Create promotional bundle: \"Super Cruise launch: 20% off when combined with annual plan\". Launch in minutes.\n\n**Why this matters**: - Marketing can test new packages",

    "content": "without engineering - Sales can create custom bundles for enterprise deals - Product team can iterate based on what actually sells - Customers see clear upgrade paths\n\n### Capability 3: Seamless Buying Experience\n\n**What it does**: Let customers discover, compare, configure, buy, and manage subscriptions themselves.\n\n**The problem it solves**: Today, customers expect to: - Browse and compare options online - Configure exactly what they need - Buy without talking to sales - Change their subscription themselves\n\nBut complex subscriptions require sales involvement because the systems aren't built for self-service.\n\n**How our solution works**:\n\n**Discovery**: Show the right products to each customer - Based on their location, company size, current subscriptions - Highlight relevant bundles and packages - Smart recommendations\n\n**Comparison**: Help them understand options - Clear feature comparison - Show upgrade paths - Explain what they get at each tier\n\n**Configuration**: Build what they need - Select products from available bundles - Choose add-ons - See price update in real-time\n\n**Purchase**: Complete transaction - Handle payment - Apply promotions automatically - Create subscription immediately\n\n**Management**: Let them modify later - Upgrade/downgrade plans - Add/remove features - Update payment methods - All within contract terms\n\n**Real example - QHR Technologies**: - **Before**: Customers call sales to configure, get quote, complete purchase. Takes days. High abandonment. - **After**: Customers browse packages (Doctor Package, Clinic Package), configure based on their province, add optional features, purchase online. Complete in minutes.\n\n**Why this matters**: - Reduce sales cycle time - Increase conversion rates - Lower cost per sale - Better customer experience\n\n---\n\n## How It Works Together\n\n### Simple Scenario: New Customer in Germany\n\n**Without our solution**: 1.

Let the product leaders build unencumbered and in the best partnerships with the engineering team.\"\n\n**Why Insulation Matters:** - Product teams can't \"live consistently outside of their own products\" - it's too hard - They need focus to ship News Corp, New York Post, core customers - CPQ needs to stay stable for Boone's B2B customers - Each team has specific deliverables and commitments\n\n**The Reality of Disruption:** > \"Even if we have a strategy, the business will create conflict. There will always be: if we just have this thing, we'll win a $500K deal or $10M deal.

Strategy makes the trade-offs visible and manageable.\n\n---\n\n### **Layer 3: THE ARCHITECTURE (Bottom of Bun)** **What it is:** The foundational patterns and principles that enable the story\n\n**Components:** - Shared services at intersections - Common architectural patterns - API contracts and integration standards - Data layer and context management - Technical governance\n\n**Primary Owners:** Nav (lead architect) + Errol (chief architect) + Engineering\n\n**Purpose:** Technical foundation that makes the customer journey technically possible\n\n**Critical Question:** > \"How do you **architect** the intersection? Not engineer it, but architect it. What are the patterns we need to think about? What are the services we have or would need to build? What is the lift that comes with all of that?\"\n\n---\n\n## THE CORE CONCEPT: THE INTERSECTION\n\n### **What is the Intersection?**\n\n> \"If you think about the org as a series of... it's a Venn diagram, basically. Experiences intersects with Catalog, and Catalog intersects with CPQ, and CPQ intersects with Experiences, and Experiences intersects with Orchestration. You can build this quite complex view of the organization, which is a collection of the product roadmaps, but **the intersections**... And I think the big problem with Zuora has been that **no one has ever focused on the intersection**. The intersection is the story, and it is the platform story.\"\n\n### **Where the Intersection Currently Lives (Poorly)**\n\n**Current State:** - Interlock meetings (mostly ineffective) - Dependencies (\"one team creates a dependency on the other team, but it's abstracted away from the reason\") - Ad hoc coordination - Fragmented, reactive\n\n**The Problem:** > \"The intersection currently lives in a couple of places. It's either things like interlock meetings, or it is dependencies. Again, we're not going to completely get away from that, but that's typically how things have worked.\"\n\n### **What the Intersection Should Be**\n\n> \"I think about the business as: the **problem statement is in the intersection**, and **the intersection is how the customer sees us**.\"\n\n**The Intersection Is:** - Where products connect - How capabilities combine - Where customer journey happens - How value gets delivered - **Where platform gets built**\n\n**The Strategic Shift:** > \"There's a product motion: build a roadmap. But there's a **second product motion**: build the intersection. That's the platform. **No one has typically owned the intersection. It's always been about the roadmaps.** When you make the intersection a roadmap, that's when you build platform.\"\n\n---\n\n## THE TWO PRODUCT MOTIONS\n\n### **Product Motion 1: Build the Roadmaps (Traditional)**\n\n**What it is:** Individual product teams shipping features\n\n**Characteristics:** - Prod",

That's where we become platform.\"\n\n**What Needs to Be Built:** 1. **Data Layer** (First Priority) - Customer behavioral data - Sales rep context and performance - Lifecycle awareness - Pre-quote information - Usage patterns - Analytics across products\n\n2. **Commerce Rules Engine** - One rules engine (not each product building own) - Shared pricing/rating service - Common constraints logic - Merchandising rules\n\n3. **Catalog Service** - Common catalog across products - Bundles (hard/soft) - Product relationships - Offer management\n\n4. **Journey Builder / Qualification Engine** - For PLG/self-serve entry - Context building - Self-qualification flows - Offer orchestration - \"Almost like a qualification engine... in PLG, it's just the branches are a lot less complex\"\n\n5. **Vibe Quoting / CPQ Integration** - Light quoting for early-stage customers - Full CPQ for complex needs - \"Vibe quoting feels like a really good thing to give to someone who's not ready to buy full CPQ\" - Should be architected as one capability, not two projects\n\n### **The Key Architectural Principle**\n\n> \"You need to insulate the core product roadmap because it's the thing that gets News Corp live, or keeps the New York Post ticking over. But the bit you're talking about, that level up, that's the abstraction of the intersection. That's the bit where: what is that thing?

And Silver Lake just want a financial engineer, then nothing that we do matters, won't make any difference at all. Right? So those are the realities.\"\n\n**The Pragmatic View:** Jonathan acknowledges the possibility that Silver Lake only cares about 3x return in 3 years through financial engineering, not product platform.\n\n**The Opportunity View:** > \"I suspect the thing they're not looking at is: what's going to be the state of the market three years from now, and is 3x possibly **5x or 10x** if you do the platform thing really well? Especially in this kind of data landscape.\"\n\n**Strategic Bet:** Platform creates optionality for much higher returns than pure financial engineering.\n\n---\n\n## THE EXECUTION PHILOSOPHY\n\n### **Principle 1: Insulate Product Roadmaps**\n\n> \"Product roadmaps need to be insulated. Let the product leaders build unencumbered. That's the core principle. The product that is in the JIRAs - that's the corporate.\"\n\n**Why:** - Product teams need focus - Can't deliver if constantly disrupted - News Corp, New York Post, Toyota - these customers need products to work\n\n**But:** - Insulation isn't absolute - Big deals ($10M+) will disrupt - Strategy makes trade-offs visible\n\n---\n\n### **Principle 2: Build the Intersection as a Roadmap**\n\n> \"When you make the intersection a roadmap, that's when you build platform.\"\n\n**What this means:** - Intersection isn't just coordination meetings - Intersection becomes its own product motion - Jonathan + Nav own intersection roadmap - Architectural principles + shared services - Product teams are customers of intersection\n\n---\n\n### **Principle 3: Product Teams Are Stakeholders AND Customers**\n\n> \"I said to Errol and Manfred and Satish: they are both **stakeholders and customers** of this story. They have an investment into it - without their support, you don't get that investment. They're also customers of it. We have to be in selling mode all the time back to them.\"\n\n**What this means:** - Not top-down mandates - Continuous engagement and selling - Face-to-face collaboration essential - Their input shapes the intersection - They consume what intersection builds\n\n---\n\n### **Principle 4: Outcomes First, Tools Second**\n\n**On Zephyr (journey orchestration tool):** > \"We should not discuss or think about what'",

You're building up context of the customer, then that calls catalog and returns offers.\"\n\n**The Concept:** - PLG needs qualification/journey builder - But: \"branches are just a lot less complex\" than full B2C journey orchestration - Don't want gap in last mile where another system needed - \"Almost like a qualification engine\" is better framing than \"journey orchestration\"\n\n---\n\n### **4.
