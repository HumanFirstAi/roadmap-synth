      "answer": "## Answer:\n\n**The provided documentation does not contain specific information about how the new CPQ will handle version sprawl issues.** This question is actually listed in the \"Pending Questions\" section itself, indicating it remains unanswered within the current roadmap materials.\n\nHowever, based on the available context, I can provide some relevant observations:\n\n**What we know about the current situation:**\n\nAccording to **TEAM-STRUCTURED documentation**, there is significant version fragmentation in the current state: \"Most Customers who have CPQ are on major release 10,\" which implies customers are spread across different versions. The **TEAM-CONVERSATIONAL source** confirms multiple CPQ products exist simultaneously: \"We've got cpqx... the next generation of CPQ, which is currently being built. Then we've got this new vibe quoting.\"\n\n**Potential strategic direction:**\n\nThe **ENGINEERING documentation** mentions a \"2 way sync (including data connect) will continue and may have to be enhanced. New sync adapters will be built to understand the grammar of various applications.\" This suggests the NextGen CPQ may use sync adapters as part of its architecture, which *could* potentially address version compatibility, but this is not explicitly stated.\n\nThe **Theme 2: CPQ Excellence roadmap item** focuses on \"Sales teams can close complex B2B deals faster with fewer errors\" but does not address migration or version consolidation strategy.\n\n**Gap:** There is no documented migration strategy, version consolidation plan, or technical approach for handling customers on multiple CPQ versions during or after the transition to NextGen CPQ.\n\n**Confidence: Low**\n\n**Reasoning:** The question itself is listed as pending/unanswered in the documentation. While there are references to multiple CPQ versions existing and some architectural components that might be relevant, there is no explicit strategy documented for addressing version sprawl.\n\n## Related Pending Questions:\n- What is the planned approach for migrating existing Apex customizations - transpilation, DSL conversion, or hybrid?\n\n## Suggested Follow-ups:\n- What is the migration timeline for customers moving from CPQ-X to NextGen CPQ?\n- Will there be a parallel run period where multiple CPQ versions are supported simultaneously?\n- Are there plans to consolidate customers onto a single CPQ version, or will version sprawl continue with NextGen CPQ?\n- What backwards compatibility guarantees will NextGen CPQ provide for customers on older versions?",
