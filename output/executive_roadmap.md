# Zuora Commerce Platform: Executive Roadmap Summary

## Strategic Narrative

Zuora is building the commerce platform that lets customers grow from startup to enterprise without changing systems. This "vendor for life" position is our competitive moat—a customer starting at $50M in revenue can scale to $1B+ on Zuora, something neither Stripe nor Salesforce can credibly offer without painful migrations.

The strategic investment thesis centers on owning the **intersection**—the architectural layer where our products connect. Today, customers experience friction when moving between self-serve acquisition and sales-assisted motions, or when expanding from simple subscriptions to complex enterprise agreements. We're investing to eliminate that friction entirely, creating seamless omni-channel commerce.

**Why now:** The market is consolidating around unified commerce platforms. Gartner and Forrester both point toward composable, API-first architectures that span the full customer lifecycle. We have a 6-12 month window to establish this position before competitors—particularly Salesforce Revenue Cloud's rebuild and Stripe's upstream expansion—close the gap. Simultaneously, our CPQ Magic Quadrant re-entry depends on demonstrating enterprise-grade capabilities that our current Salesforce-native architecture cannot deliver at scale.

## Investment Themes

### 1. CPQ Modernization (Next Gen CPQ)
**Business Rationale:** Current CPQ cannot handle enterprise-scale quotes (100+ line items) and is constrained by Salesforce architecture. This blocks deals and damages competitive positioning.

**Expected Outcome:** Return to Gartner Magic Quadrant; 40% faster deal cycles for complex B2B; ability to close enterprise deals currently lost on performance

**Resource Requirement:** Significant—this is the largest single investment

**Timeline:** Core capabilities Q1-Q2; Magic Quadrant readiness Q4

### 2. Commerce Foundation (Intersection Layer)
**Business Rationale:** Every product team is building connection points independently, creating fragmentation and technical debt. Unified platform services enable omni-channel and reduce long-term engineering costs.

**Expected Outcome:** Customers move seamlessly between self-serve and sales-assisted; 60% reduction in implementation time; platform extensibility that supports future growth

**Resource Requirement:** Moderate dedicated team, but requires reallocation decision

**Timeline:** Foundation Q1-Q2; omni-channel demonstration Q3; full capability Q4+

### 3. Experience Layer & Reference Architecture
**Business Rationale:** Implementation cost and complexity is killing EMEA deals (60% of that market isn't B2B complex). We need pre-built templates and faster time-to-value.

**Expected Outcome:** 4-week implementations instead of 12-week; unlock EMEA pipeline; reduce GS dependency for standard deployments

**Resource Requirement:** Moderate—primarily product and GS partnership

**Timeline:** Templates Q2; reference architecture Q2-Q3

## Key Decisions Required

**1. Intersection Team Authority**
The platform architecture vision is sound, but no one currently owns it with decision-making authority and dedicated resources. Recommendation: Establish explicit ownership with product and technical leads empowered to make architectural decisions that affect multiple teams.

**2. CPQ X Sunset Timeline**
We're maintaining two CPQ platforms, splitting engineering attention. Recommendation: Commit to 18-month maintenance window for current CPQ, minimal investment, with explicit sunset when Next Gen reaches parity.

**3. Stage 1/Stage 2 Customer Investment**
Silver Lake's "B2B complex" mandate is being interpreted as *only* B2B complex. This leaves 60% of EMEA business and our entire "vendor for life" entry point under-invested. Recommendation: Assign dedicated ownership to the $50M-$250M customer journey.

**4. May SKO Commitment**
Can we demonstrate omni-channel capability at SKO? This requires cross-team coordination and may need resource acceleration. Decide now whether to commit—if yes, staff accordingly.

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Intersection remains unowned** | Platform vision never materializes; products stay siloed | Executive decision on authority within 30 days |
| **Engineering fragmentation** | Multiple teams building redundant rules/pricing logic | Architectural consolidation mandate |
| **Next Gen CPQ timeline** | Conversations suggest complexity beyond documented estimates | Buffer expectations; protect core deliverables |
| **Competitor acceleration** | Salesforce Revenue Cloud rebuild; Stripe upstream expansion | 6-month execution focus on differentiated capabilities |
| **EMEA revenue leak** | Every quarter without reference architecture loses deals | Prioritize templates and implementation simplification |

## Bottom Line

**The vision is right.** Omni-channel commerce with seamless customer journeys is where the market is heading, and we have genuine differentiation in finance system integration that competitors lack.

**The gap is execution authority.** The intersection concept requires someone to own it with resources and decision-making power. Without this, product teams will continue optimizing locally while the platform opportunity slips away.

**The timeline is real.** Market consolidation is happening now. The investment in CPQ and platform foundation over the next two quarters determines whether we're positioned as the unified commerce leader or defending a billing-only position.
