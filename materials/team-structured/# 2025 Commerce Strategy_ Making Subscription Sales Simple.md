\*\*Version\*\*: 1.0    
\*\*Date\*\*: November 2024    
\*\*Authors\*\*: Errol Denger, Nav Jain

\---

\#\# Executive Summary

\#\#\# The Problem  
Our customers are losing revenue because managing subscription pricing, packaging, and sales is too complicated. Changing prices takes weeks instead of minutes. Customers see the wrong offers. Sales teams can't quickly create custom packages.

\*\*Real example\*\*: A company wants to offer 20% off annual plans in Germany. Today, this requires updating five different systems and takes two weeks. By then, the competitive moment is gone.

\#\#\# What We're Building  
Three connected capabilities that work together:

1\. \*\*Smart Context Detection\*\* \- Automatically figures out who each customer is, where they are, and what they need  
2\. \*\*Flexible Product Management\*\* \- Easy tools to create bundles, packages, and pricing that work across all channels  
3\. \*\*Seamless Buying Experience\*\* \- Let customers discover, compare, configure, and buyâ€”without talking to a sales rep

\#\#\# Business Impact  
\- \*\*Time savings\*\*: What takes weeks happens in minutes  
\- \*\*Revenue growth\*\*: Right offers to right customers \= higher conversion  
\- \*\*Market expansion\*\*: Launch in new regions and channels faster  
\- \*\*Competitive advantage\*\*: Do things Salesforce and Stripe can't

\#\#\# Investment Needed  
\- \*\*Phase 1\*\* (Q1 2025): Foundation work with existing team \+ 2 additional engineers  
\- \*\*Phase 2\*\* (Q2 2025): Scale capabilities with \+10 team members  
\- \*\*Phase 3\*\* (Q3 2025): Complete solution with \+8 team members

\*\*Expected return\*\*: $86M revenue in Year 1, growing to $335M by Year 3

\#\# Why This Matters Now

\#\#\# What Customers Tell Us

\*\*GM OnStar\*\* (In-vehicle subscriptions):  
\> "We launch new features every month, but creating the right bundles and pricing for different customer types requires engineering work. We want to test and launch new offerings in days, not quarters."

\*\*QHR Technologies\*\* (Healthcare software):  
\> "We sell across multiple Canadian provinces, each with different pricing rules and packages. Managing this complexity means we move slowly, and our customers get confused about what they're buying."

\*\*Multiple B2B SaaS companies\*\*:  
\> "Our prospects expect to configure and buy online like they do with Stripe, but our products are too complex for simple checkout. We need something in between."

\#\#\# The Market Reality

\*\*87% of buyers\*\* expect personalized experiences, but only 23% of companies can deliver them consistently.

\*\*58% of CEOs\*\* are launching new business models and product lines, but their commerce systems can't keep up.

\*\*76% of enterprises\*\* plan to launch in new markets or channels in the next 18 months, but setup takes too long.

\*\*The pattern\*\*: Everyone needs to move faster and personalize more, but existing tools make this hard or impossible.

\#\#\# Competitive Threat

\*\*Salesforce\*\* is rebuilding their entire commerce platform and will launch in 2025\. They're marketing it as "complete revenue platform for subscriptions."

\*\*Stripe\*\* continues making their simple model work for more complex scenarios. They're winning the "easy" segment we should own.

\*\*If we don't act\*\*: We lose deals to Salesforce at the high end and Stripe at the low end. We become just a billing engine.

\*\*If we execute well\*\*: We own the category of "Total Monetization" \- the only platform that handles truly complex subscription commerce.

\#\# What We're Building

\#\#\# The Big Picture

Think of three layers that work together:

\`\`\`

Each layer builds on the one below. Each can be sold separately, but together they're more powerful.

\#\#\# Capability 1: Smart Context Detection

\*\*What it does\*\*: Automatically figures out who the customer is and what they should see.

\*\*The problem it solves\*\*:  
Today, if you sell in multiple countries with different pricing, you need to:  
\- Manually configure pricing for each location  
\- Update multiple systems when anything changes  
\- Hope everything stays in sync

\*\*How our solution works\*\*:  
1\. Customer visits your website from Germany  
2\. System automatically detects: Location \= Germany, Channel \= Website, Customer Type \= New Visitor  
3\. System applies: Euro pricing, German terms, appropriate product catalog  
4\. Customer sees the right offer instantly

\*\*Real example \- Healthcare Company\*\*:  
\- \*\*Before\*\*: Must charge 10% premium for HIPAA-compliant storage. This requires manually updating pricing across four systems. Takes days. Easy to make mistakes.  
\- \*\*After\*\*: Set rule once: "If Healthcare customer, add 10%". Applies automatically. Updates everywhere instantly.

\*\*Why this matters\*\*:   
\- Set up new regions in minutes instead of weeks  
\- Never show wrong prices to customers  
\- Change strategy instantly (raise prices, run promotions, launch bundles)

\#\#\# Capability 2: Flexible Product Management

\*\*What it does\*\*: Easy tools to create bundles, packages, tiered offerings, and promotions.

\*\*The problem it solves\*\*:  
Today, creating a bundle like "Professional Package \= Software \+ Support \+ Training" requires:  
\- Custom coding  
\- Separate setup in each system  
\- Hard to change once created  
\- Difficult to show relationships between products

\*\*How our solution works\*\*:

\*\*Packages\*\* \- Pre-built combinations:  
\- Create "Startup Bundle" \= Product A \+ Product B \+ Support  
\- Set package price (can be different from individual prices)  
\- Add package-level discount  
\- Done \- available everywhere automatically

\*\*Bundles\*\* \- Customer choice:  
\- Create "Pick 3 Channels" from 10 available options  
\- Set rules: minimum 2, maximum 5  
\- Price each option differently  
\- Let customers build their own plan

\*\*Features\*\* \- Building blocks:  
\- Define what features exist (Lock/Unlock, Super Cruise, Premium Support)  
\- Attach pricing to features  
\- Combine features into products flexibly

\*\*Real example \- GM OnStar\*\*:  
\- \*\*Before\*\*: Every new feature requires creating new product in system. Want to bundle "Super Cruise \+ Security \+ Apps"? Requires engineering work to connect them.  
\- \*\*After\*\*: Define bundle rules: "Super Cruise only available with Premium package". Create promotional bundle: "Super Cruise launch: 20% off when combined with annual plan". Launch in minutes.

\*\*Why this matters\*\*:  
\- Marketing can test new packages without engineering  
\- Sales can create custom bundles for enterprise deals  
\- Product team can iterate based on what actually sells  
\- Customers see clear upgrade paths

\#\#\# Capability 3: Seamless Buying Experience

\*\*What it does\*\*: Let customers discover, compare, configure, buy, and manage subscriptions themselves.

\*\*The problem it solves\*\*:  
Today, customers expect to:  
\- Browse and compare options online  
\- Configure exactly what they need  
\- Buy without talking to sales  
\- Change their subscription themselves

But complex subscriptions require sales involvement because the systems aren't built for self-service.

\*\*How our solution works\*\*:

\*\*Discovery\*\*: Show the right products to each customer  
\- Based on their location, company size, current subscriptions  
\- Highlight relevant bundles and packages  
\- Smart recommendations

\*\*Comparison\*\*: Help them understand options  
\- Clear feature comparison  
\- Show upgrade paths  
\- Explain what they get at each tier

\*\*Configuration\*\*: Build what they need  
\- Select products from available bundles  
\- Choose add-ons  
\- See price update in real-time

\*\*Purchase\*\*: Complete transaction  
\- Handle payment  
\- Apply promotions automatically  
\- Create subscription immediately

\*\*Management\*\*: Let them modify later  
\- Upgrade/downgrade plans  
\- Add/remove features  
\- Update payment methods  
\- All within contract terms

\*\*Real example \- QHR Technologies\*\*:  
\- \*\*Before\*\*: Customers call sales to configure, get quote, complete purchase. Takes days. High abandonment.  
\- \*\*After\*\*: Customers browse packages (Doctor Package, Clinic Package), configure based on their province, add optional features, purchase online. Complete in minutes.

\*\*Why this matters\*\*:  
\- Reduce sales cycle time  
\- Increase conversion rates  
\- Lower cost per sale  
\- Better customer experience

\#\# How It Works Together

\#\#\# Simple Scenario: New Customer in Germany

\*\*Without our solution\*\*:  
1\. Customer visits website â†’ sees USD pricing â†’ confused  
2\. Calls sales â†’ waits for callback  
3\. Sales creates custom quote manually â†’ takes days  
4\. Customer buys elsewhere (too slow)

\*\*With our solution\*\*:  
1\. Customer visits website from Germany  
   \- \*\*Smart Context\*\* detects location automatically  
2\. System shows Euro pricing and German product catalog  
   \- \*\*Flexible Products\*\* shows right packages for German market  
3\. Customer compares plans, configures what they need  
   \- \*\*Buying Experience\*\* lets them do this themselves  
4\. Customer completes purchase  
   \- All happens in 10 minutes

\#\#\# Complex Scenario: Enterprise Custom Bundle

\*\*Without our solution\*\*:  
1\. Enterprise wants custom bundle of 5 products with special pricing  
2\. Sales creates quote manually in spreadsheet  
3\. Sends to deal desk for approval â†’ wait  
4\. Deal desk manually creates products in billing system â†’ takes days  
5\. Often errors in translation from quote to system  
6\. Customer gets confused by invoice

\*\*With our solution\*\*:  
1\. Sales rep uses bundle builder to create custom package  
   \- \*\*Flexible Products\*\* lets them combine any products with rules  
2\. Applies enterprise discount rules automatically  
   \- \*\*Smart Context\*\* knows this is enterprise customer with special terms  
3\. System validates bundle is allowed, calculates price  
   \- Everything stays in sync automatically  
4\. Customer approves and signs  
   \- \*\*Buying Experience\*\* generates correct subscription immediately  
5\. First invoice is exactly what they expected

\#\# Conclusion

\#\#\# The Simple Story

\*\*Today\*\*: Selling subscriptions is too hard. Customers can't get what they need. We're losing deals.

\*\*Tomorrow\*\*: Selling subscriptions is easy. Customers get exactly what they need. We win deals.

\*\*How we get there\*\*: Build the three capabilities described in this document, in the sequence outlined, with the team and budget requested.

\#\#\# The Bottom Line

\- \*\*Problem\*\*: Real and urgent (ask GM, ask QHR, ask our sales team)  
\- \*\*Solution\*\*: Clear and achievable (phased approach, proven patterns)  
\- \*\*Market\*\*: Large and growing ($900M realistic opportunity)  
\- \*\*Competition\*\*: Beatable (we have advantages if we move now)  
\- \*\*Risk\*\*: Manageable (phased approach limits downside)  
\- \*\*Return\*\*: Substantial ($620M over 3 years)

\*\*The only question\*\*: Do we want to lead this market or cede it to competitors?

\*\*We believe\*\*: This is Zuora's moment to define Total Monetization for the subscription economy.
