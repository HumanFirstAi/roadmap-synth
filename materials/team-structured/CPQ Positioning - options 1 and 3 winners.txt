Total Cost 3 years

1 Contractor (reduce over time
2 Engineers (reduce over time)

Invest in defense strategy:
Build SFDC CPQ and SFDC RCA connectors & will require GS <> product <> partner  investment
Churn Risk prevention of $1M ARR (from 17 projected accounts)

Expected Revenue vs. Cost next 3 years
Why this is Good/Not Advised?
+ Low investment yields a high impact to prevent suite churn. Churn prevention effect will offset investment cost in Year 1
+ Increase YoY revenue generated
- Competes with CPQ investment strategy (takes away focus on own CPQ, doing too many things at the same time)

No Investment in CPQ: Investment Profile
Reduce CPQ to support and some minimal investments possible with reduced team 
Total Cost 3 years
CPQ team reduced to support as of 1/1/2025:  
5 engineers
1 PMs

No significant investment into CPQ:
L3, some select smaller areas invested into CPQ, e.g., add most important billing parity items
Why this is Good/Not Advised?
+ Allows Zuora to focus on backend app investments, focus attention to finance areas 
+ Aligns with the current decision maker and buyer (CFO, CAO)
- Provides a fundamental product catalog risk for any CPQ, Billing, or OTC solution to replace Zuora
- Limits Zuora sellers to showcase Zuora backend specific data (Zoom Shan G.: ultimately this is a fight about data and what is available to an (AI) agent in CPQ)
- Slow decline (bad churn prevention) in Zuora CPQ revenue, e.g.: investment strategy does not allow to address biggest issue for customers (e.g.: system performance, full billing parity)
Churn Risk prevention of $169M ARR (from 268 active CPQ accounts)

Professional Services high effort due to missing functionality (16 areas).

Invest in CPQ:
Table Stakes Functional Gaps (23)
Billing gaps (9)
Why this is Good/Not Advised?
+ Defends against current Zuora competition and retains product catalog ownership (good churn prevention) 
+ Allows Zuora sellers to show the entire value of Zuora upstream where revenue is generated “Tip of the Spear”
+ Allows Zuora to become integral to our customers’ revenue generating function (sales/GTM) vs efficiency/back office play
+ Has potential to increase new sales of CPQ, sell into Billing and SFDC install base and pull through new sales of Billing & Revenue
- Does not align with the current decision maker and buyer (CFO, CAO)
- Limits Zuora sellers to showcase Zuora backend specific data (Zoom Shan G.: ultimately this is a fight about data and what is available to an (AI) agent)

Example Nue.IO , success of selling a suite

Nue.IO Number of customers : expect this to be around 90-100. Latest number in the CPQ Sales Report was 70 (that was in May ’25)
- Growth Rates
they claim to win ~70% of deals against Salesforce and Zuora
they claim to see ~70% growth rate in Europe
At the time of the CPQ Sales Report their number of employees was 90, now only 5 months later it’s 134 according to LinkedIn!
their previous customer target (ICP) was from $20M - $100M, longer-term (which has already started) is $100M - $300M

CPQ Differentiated: Investment Profile
“Niche provider” analyst ranking for visionary in SaaS
Why this is Good/Not Advised?
+ Become a niche leader in the SaaS CPQ space
+ upside ARR growth, land and expand motion, up-sell Billing and rest of Zuora backend
+ opens up CPQ TAM to standalone use cases
- no current GTM (sales and marketing) to support, 
- CPQ is not company DNA
- cedes product catalog 
- eliminates core differentiation of Zuora suite
- High Risk due to fierce competition in CPQ market, hard to make case why Best in Class differentiation if smaller niche players and large CPQ vendors are good enough
