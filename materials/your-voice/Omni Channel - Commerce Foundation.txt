Becoming a “Vendor for Life”

The commerce foundation
What is it - right commerce experience, for the right persona, anywhere
Business Objective: Deliver true omni-channel commerce across the entire sales spectrum—from AI agents and self-serve to sales-led
The Opportunity: Zuora is the only platform that can serve PLG → SLG → and back
The Solution: Build "an intersection roadmap" as a dedicated roadmap with composable architecture that delivers commerce foundation
The Core: Leverage existing product investments (CPQ, Catalog, Experiences, Zephr) as the substrate
This is your opening frame. Lead with what Sales and GTM already understand: "Customers want to package, price, and sell—give it to me." Establish that this isn't about building something new from scratch—it's about creating the connective tissue that makes our existing investments work together. The intersection is what transforms individual products into a unified platform. Note: The full spectrum includes AI agents on the far left (agent serves you), through web self-service and session switching, all the way to sales rep assisted on the far right.

NOAM focus on BTB Complex
Focus on the core roadmap delivery
Steven Boone
SVP & GM GTM
NOAM
Bottom Line: Boone's Core Messages

Focus on core products (billing, CPQ) for complex B2B enterprise deals. Don't dilute resources on journey orchestration or peripheral capabilities that customers aren't asking for. Build from the core outward, not from the periphery inward.

Sales strategy should be driven by actual customer demand and conversations. What matters is what customers are buying today and what makes Zuora competitive in actual deals.

Protect CPQ and core product roadmaps. Commerce and experience capabilities are valuable as add-ons, but only in service of the core billing/CPQ/revenue recognition systems.

SaaS growth in EMEA is driving opportunities
If we unlock self serve we drive 60% of EMEA’s business

EMEA
Bottom Line: Paulo’s Core Messages

Our market is fundamentally different. EMEA companies are 1/10th the size of US equivalents. A $3B US SaaS company = $300M in EMEA. We need modular, self-serve, reference implementations. We can only win complex deals - Stripe beats us on everything simple.

The platform story you're building? We desperately need it. Self-serve motion, modular approach, grow-with-us without rip-and-replace - this is exactly what EMEA requires to compete.

Bottom Line: Marc’s Core Messages

Customers don't live in boxes - they dial capabilities up and down. Think of it as an equalizer with four knobs: Self-Serve | PLG | Sales-Assist | Sales-Led. Customers turn each up or down based on where they're at and what their objectives are. "The ability to turn them up or down depending on where they're at and what their objectives are, is our secret capability."
The customer journey is NOT linear - it's dynamic. They start self-serve, grow into PLG, maybe need sales-assist for a big contract, then dial back to product-led when CAC gets too high. Or they run all four simultaneously - self-serve for small customers, sales-led for enterprise. This is the real motion: customers configure their own go-to-market mix using our platform.

Commerce Foundation for True Omni-Channel Commerce

The layers of commerce foundation

Multiple Layer, Universal Use: Implemented once and consumed by all entry points. C2, C1, and Agentic all use the same action—orchestrator just provides different context and permissions.
Composable UI - components that can be assembled differently for different customer segments
The intelligence layer - determines what lights up for each user based on persona, permissions, stage, and history
Orchestration - strings actions together into business processes
Shared services - including unified rules engine, pricing, catalog, and commerce capabilities; Core domains: Package, Price, Promote

How context drives composition

How GTM will see it - Self-Serve Customer Experience
Context defines the experience: A PLG customer's persona, permissions, and stage automatically determines what they see
Right-sized capabilities: Only relevant experiences "light up"—no overwhelming complexity for simple needs
Appropriate rules execute: The unified rules engine knows which rules apply to this segment
DRIVES
USES
Friction-free journey: The result is a fast and simple experience appropriate for stage 1

How context drives composition

How GTM will see it - Sales-Led Customer Experience
Same foundation, expanded capabilities: Everything from self-serve PLUS advanced features for complex B2B
Context unlocks complexity: The same components exist—elevated context "turns on" more capabilities
Rules layer appropriately: Common rules plus segment-specific rules for enterprise customers
DRIVES
USES
Full power when needed: Sales reps have access to everything required for complex deals
RESULTS
IN
"The only thing that changes is at this point, more is lighting up and interconnected. Same core, elevated permissions."
Complete the comparison. The same platform serves both a simple PLG customer AND a $100M enterprise deal. The difference is context, not a different product. This is the power of composability—one platform, many compositions.

True Omni-Channel in action

Customer journey from Self-Serve to Sales-Assisted
"Touch point + Context = Perfect experience formulation. Both have slightly different views given the context, but they share a common view."
This is your customer story. Walk through the journey step by step. Use the language "orchestrate and formulate the right experience"—this resonates better than technical jargon. Emphasize that today, this handoff often means starting over or losing context. The intersection makes this seamless because context is a first-class citizen of the architecture. The key insight: same customer view, context-appropriate representation.

True Omni-Channel in action
Customer journey from Self-Serve to Sales-Assisted
Context preservation is the key: When a customer clicks "Talk to Sales," everything they did passes to the sales rep
No starting over: The rep sees full history—products viewed, configurations made, pricing explored
Orchestrate and formulate: The same components orchestrate and formulate the right experience based on who's using them
Different views, same customer: Both experiences "have slightly different views given the context, but they share a common view of the customer just through different representations"
Bi-directional: The customer can log back in and see the rep's work—true omni-channel

Aligning how we design and how the field sells
We deliver the sales spectrum
Not different things: Self-serve and sales-led (and anything in between) aren't separate systems—they're different compositions of the same components
Context is the selector: The context service acts as the intelligent selector that determines the composition
Transition without replacement: Customers can start with 20% of capabilities and expand to 100% without changing platforms

This also brings engineering efficiency: Build once, compose many ways—no duplicate development across product lines
This is the "aha" moment slide. The insight that self-serve and sales-assisted are compositions, not products, is the conceptual breakthrough. Make sure the audience understands this before moving forward—it's the foundation of everything that follows.

Composability in action for GTM
Different customers, different compositions, same platform
Stage 1 (Self-Serve): ~20% of blocks—simple needs, fast self-service
Stage 2 (Mid-Market): ~60% of blocks—growing complexity, some sales assist (and different Stage 2 customers may need different 60%)
Stage 3 (Enterprise): ~100% of blocks—full complexity for $10bn+ companies
“Vendor for Life”
Start anywhere of evolve from one point to another: Blocks compose as with change/growth—no rip-and-replace

One Place, All Rules
Why a Unified Rules engine is good for GTM
No crafting rules in multiple places: Today, CPQ has its own rules, catalog has separate rules, experiences has commerce logic—all fragmented
Conflict visibility: A unified engine lets you see conflicts before execution, not discover them in production
Context-appropriate execution: Common rules apply to everyone; segment-specific rules layer on top based on context
Channel-agnostic consistency: When rules execute in the same engine, decision-making remains the same regardless of channel
"When the rules are getting executed in the same engine, I know the decision-making will remain the same regardless of which interaction you execute from wherever. Channel agnostic."
This addresses a real pain point. Ask the audience: "How many of you have dealt with pricing inconsistencies across channels? How many have had bundle logic work in one system but not another?" The unified rules engine is the solution.

The Burger Framework
A focus on how customers see the value of Zuora
How capabilities combine to serve customers
Where the customer journey actually happens
How customers experience Zuora as one platform
The Strategic Shift
"There's a core product motion: build a roadmap. But there's a second product motion: build the intersection. That's the platform. No one has typically owned the intersection. When you make the intersection a roadmap, that's when you build platform."
This slide makes the case for why intersection needs its own roadmap. Be direct: previous attempts failed because coordination became dependencies, not patterns. The critical insight is that it can't be a dependency between teams (brittle, slow)—it must be a pattern that teams consume (stable, fast). This is Zuora's "one shot to put it right."

Value flows to everyone
How intersection benefits all stakeholders
For Engineering: No duplicate development, unified components, architectural coherence
For Product Teams: Deliver roadmaps faster by consuming intersection rather than building duplicate capabilities
For The Business: Serve customers from $50M to $10B+ on one platform
For Customers: Grow without ripping out systems, seamless experience across all channels and bi-directional

How to talk about this
Evolution, Not Revolution
This is crucial for internal alignment. The framing that worked in the meeting: position as the natural next phase in a progression, not something new. Reference past wins to establish credibility. Be careful about billing/core system territory—"by staying out of that, we reduce friction." How you talk about this determines whether you get collaboration or resistance. Use this framing consistently.

This is a strategy to solve for the anti-pattern
One Zuora. Continuous journey. Zero disruption
Current market reality
Start with Stripe (simple, self-serve-friendly)
Grow and hit limitations
→ Painful rip-and-replace

Build toward a Vendor for Life vision
Start with Zuora (simple entry)
Grow with Zuora (scales with you)
→ No rip-and-replace required

Three-layers, one outcome

Can a customer go from self-serve all the way through to sales-sales, and back again? That's the intersection story. That’s “Vendor for Life”.

Technical foundation that enables the story

Data as a new moat

Subscriber data compounds - each interaction makes the entire system smarter and more valuable and accelerates go-to-market.
The Data

How it solves some of the stakeholder concerns

What I heard across the organization
Protect the Core - coordination means we treat product leaders as stakeholders and not dependencies
Eliminate duplication risk - one thing serving all applications
Have a clear architectural foundation (bottom bun) - with defined services and APIs before building features
Capture missing upstream data—sales rep info, pre-quote context, behavioral signals
Give me options - I want my sales team to be able to position Zuora at any point in the customer journey

Strategic alignment to the sales reality
Understanding constraint
Reality 1: Disruptions will happen to product roadmaps
"Even if we have a strategy, the business will create conflict. There will always be: if we just have this thing, we'll win a $500K deal."

Strategy Response:
Make trade-offs visible, not prevent disruptions. Strategy doesn't prevent disruptions. Strategy makes the trade-offs visible and manageable.

Measurable outcomes - success and risks

Manage risks:
Requirements must use the roadmap not create a new one
Investment (time and materials) must be stack-ranked and validated
Need to ensure we are not creating mis-alignment
Ensure we do not stray into territory where we have no right to play
