\# JONATHAN HARRIS: PLATFORM STRATEGY DOCUMENT  
\#\# The Customer Lifecycle Vision: $50M to $1B Journey

\---

\#\# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

\*\*The Core Idea:\*\*  
Build Zuora as a platform that takes a customer from \*\*$50 million to a couple of billion\*\* through their entire lifecycle \- from self-serve beginnings to complex enterprise needs \- \*\*without requiring them to rip out systems and start over.\*\*

\*\*The Strategic Shift:\*\*  
From siloed product roadmaps to \*\*"building the intersection"\*\* \- where products connect and where customers actually experience Zuora.

\*\*The Fundamental Insight:\*\*  
\> "In Zuora, there are two product motions. There's a product motion: build a roadmap. But there's a second product motion: \*\*build the intersection\*\*. That's the platform. Build as the customer sees you, which is at the intersection. No one has typically owned the intersection. When you make the intersection a roadmap, that's when you build platform."

\---

\#\# THE VISION: THE CUSTOMER LIFECYCLE JOURNEY

\#\#\# \*\*The Perfect Customer Story\*\*

\> "The customer goes from $50 million B2B... they start off, they don't need much. They go through some kind of context, orchestration. They get to a plan. They buy that plan. They trial it, then they buy it. Then maybe they need a little bit of service agent, or sales rep, bit of light CPQ, but they don't need much. And then it gets a bit more complex, and so on and so on. And you get all the way from, in the perfect world, the company goes from 50 million to a couple of billion, and \*\*they've gone through a lifecycle with Zuora, without having to start with Stripe and then rip out Stripe and then put us in.\*\*"

\#\#\# \*\*The Customer Journey Stages\*\*

\*\*Stage 1: Self-Serve / PLG Beginning ($50M company)\*\*  
\- Customer lands (website, domain, channel)  
\- Self-qualification process  
  \- What domain did they come from? (.gov.uk vs other)  
  \- What's their enterprise size?  
  \- Software or hardware focus?  
\- Context building through journey/qualification engine  
\- Get to an offer/plan  
\- Trial â†’ Buy  
\- Minimal complexity needed

\*\*Stage 2: Sales-Assisted / Light Touch (Growing)\*\*  
\- Need some sales rep engagement  
\- Service agent support  
\- Light CPQ (not full complexity)  
\- More structured quoting  
\- Still relatively simple

\*\*Stage 3: Complex B2B / Enterprise (Scaling to $1B+)\*\*  
\- Full CPQ capabilities  
\- Complex configurator  
\- Advanced approvals  
\- Hard/soft bundles  
\- Merchandising rules  
\- Enterprise-grade everything

\#\#\# \*\*The Anti-Pattern We're Solving\*\*

\*\*Current Market Reality:\*\*  
\- Start with Stripe (simple, PLG-friendly)  
\- Grow and hit Stripe's limitations  
\- \*\*Painful rip-and-replace to enterprise system\*\*  
\- Business disruption, technical debt, lost time

\*\*Zuora Platform Vision:\*\*  
\- Start with Zuora (simple entry point)  
\- Grow with Zuora (capabilities scale with you)  
\- \*\*No rip-and-replace required\*\*  
\- Continuous journey, one platform

\---

\#\# THE STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK: THREE-LAYER MODEL

\#\#\# \*\*The "Burger Bun" Model\*\*

\> "Think about it like a burger bun. At the top, you've got \*\*the story\*\*. The story has to capture elements of the product roadmap, but it's primarily \*\*the intersection\*\*, and the intersection has to be the thing that the sales team wants to sell. You know, it's the slider from 50 million up to a billion. I can sell anywhere along that spectrum. At the bottom is \*\*the architectural principles\*\* \- what is the pattern that we need to build to enable that story. And then in the middle is \*\*the product\*\* \- lettuce, tomato, burger, mayonnaise, I don't care. You can pick and mix the product."

\#\#\# \*\*Layer 1: THE STORY (Top of Bun)\*\*  
\*\*What it is:\*\* How we present Zuora to customers and the market

\*\*Components:\*\*  
\- The customer lifecycle journey ($50M â†’ $1B)  
\- The value proposition (grow without rip-and-replace)  
\- The sales narrative (can sell anywhere along spectrum)  
\- The intersection story (how products work together)  
\- The platform promise (one Zuora, many capabilities)

\*\*Primary Owner:\*\* Jonathan \+ Product Marketing (but rooted in intersection reality)

\*\*Purpose:\*\* This is what sales sells. This is how customers see us.

\---

\#\#\# \*\*Layer 2: THE PRODUCT (Middle \- The Filling)\*\*  
\*\*What it is:\*\* The individual product roadmaps

\*\*Components:\*\*  
\- CPQ (Next Gen, improvements, configurator)  
\- Experiences (My Account, portals, commerce)  
\- Catalog (bundles, merchandising rules)  
\- Billing (core engine)  
\- Payments (integration, orchestration)  
\- Orchestration (journey/qualification)

\*\*Primary Owners:\*\* Product leaders (Manfred, Errol, others)

\*\*Critical Principle: INSULATION\*\*  
\> "Product roadmaps, which are driven by experienced product leaders, need to be \*\*insulated\*\* in order to deliver that roadmap. Insulation means there have to be some ground rules. Let the product leaders build unencumbered and in the best partnerships with the engineering team."

\*\*Why Insulation Matters:\*\*  
\- Product teams can't "live consistently outside of their own products" \- it's too hard  
\- They need focus to ship News Corp, New York Post, core customers  
\- CPQ needs to stay stable for Boone's B2B customers  
\- Each team has specific deliverables and commitments

\*\*The Reality of Disruption:\*\*  
\> "Even if we have a strategy, the business will create conflict. There will always be: if we just have this thing, we'll win a $500K deal or $10M deal. The thing about the strategy is: if leadership understands what it's designed to do (long term vs short term), when the short-term impact comes, you can just explain: yeah, we'll do that. But that's the impact \- that thing you want to do now moves not just one product, but \*\*moves the whole strategy out\*\*. So that's fine. You pay the bills. If you tell us to do that, we'll do it, but we're moving it over here."

\*\*Key Insight:\*\* Strategy doesn't prevent disruptions (Toyota-style $300K deals). Strategy makes the trade-offs visible and manageable.

\---

\#\#\# \*\*Layer 3: THE ARCHITECTURE (Bottom of Bun)\*\*  
\*\*What it is:\*\* The foundational patterns and principles that enable the story

\*\*Components:\*\*  
\- Shared services at intersections  
\- Common architectural patterns  
\- API contracts and integration standards  
\- Data layer and context management  
\- Technical governance

\*\*Primary Owners:\*\* Nav (lead architect) \+ Errol (chief architect) \+ Engineering

\*\*Purpose:\*\* Technical foundation that makes the customer journey technically possible

\*\*Critical Question:\*\*  
\> "How do you \*\*architect\*\* the intersection? Not engineer it, but architect it. What are the patterns we need to think about? What are the services we have or would need to build? What is the lift that comes with all of that?"

\---

\#\# THE CORE CONCEPT: THE INTERSECTION

\#\#\# \*\*What is the Intersection?\*\*

\> "If you think about the org as a series of... it's a Venn diagram, basically. Experiences intersects with Catalog, and Catalog intersects with CPQ, and CPQ intersects with Experiences, and Experiences intersects with Orchestration. You can build this quite complex view of the organization, which is a collection of the product roadmaps, but \*\*the intersections\*\*... And I think the big problem with Zuora has been that \*\*no one has ever focused on the intersection\*\*. The intersection is the story, and it is the platform story."

\#\#\# \*\*Where the Intersection Currently Lives (Poorly)\*\*

\*\*Current State:\*\*  
\- Interlock meetings (mostly ineffective)  
\- Dependencies ("one team creates a dependency on the other team, but it's abstracted away from the reason")  
\- Ad hoc coordination  
\- Fragmented, reactive

\*\*The Problem:\*\*  
\> "The intersection currently lives in a couple of places. It's either things like interlock meetings, or it is dependencies. Again, we're not going to completely get away from that, but that's typically how things have worked."

\#\#\# \*\*What the Intersection Should Be\*\*

\> "I think about the business as: the \*\*problem statement is in the intersection\*\*, and \*\*the intersection is how the customer sees us\*\*."

\*\*The Intersection Is:\*\*  
\- Where products connect  
\- How capabilities combine  
\- Where customer journey happens  
\- How value gets delivered  
\- \*\*Where platform gets built\*\*

\*\*The Strategic Shift:\*\*  
\> "There's a product motion: build a roadmap. But there's a \*\*second product motion\*\*: build the intersection. That's the platform. \*\*No one has typically owned the intersection. It's always been about the roadmaps.\*\* When you make the intersection a roadmap, that's when you build platform."

\---

\#\# THE TWO PRODUCT MOTIONS

\#\#\# \*\*Product Motion 1: Build the Roadmaps (Traditional)\*\*

\*\*What it is:\*\* Individual product teams shipping features

\*\*Characteristics:\*\*  
\- Product-centric (CPQ features, Catalog features, etc.)  
\- Team-owned (Manfred owns CPQ, Errol owns Catalog)  
\- JIRA-driven  
\- Insulated from other products  
\- Necessary and important

\*\*Limitations:\*\*  
\- Doesn't deliver integrated customer experience  
\- Creates silos  
\- Misses the "how products work together" story  
\- No one owns the customer journey

\---

\#\#\# \*\*Product Motion 2: Build the Intersection (Platform)\*\*

\*\*What it is:\*\* Owning where products connect and how customers experience Zuora holistically

\*\*Characteristics:\*\*  
\- Customer-centric (journey, lifecycle, experience)  
\- Intersection-focused (where things connect)  
\- Architecture-driven (Nav \+ Errol)  
\- Cross-product by definition  
\- \*\*This is what's been missing\*\*

\*\*Why it Matters:\*\*  
\> "The intersection is how the customer sees us. Can we go from self-serve all the way through to sales-assisted? That's the intersection story."

\*\*What it Enables:\*\*  
\- $50M â†’ $1B customer journey  
\- No rip-and-replace  
\- Unified Zuora experience  
\- Platform value proposition

\---

\#\# THE INTERSECTION ARCHITECTURE: WHAT GETS BUILT

\#\#\# \*\*The Shared Services at Intersections\*\*

\*\*From Errol's Vision (validated by Jonathan):\*\*  
\> "The edges, the intersections, are the story. That's where we become platform."

\*\*What Needs to Be Built:\*\*  
1\. \*\*Data Layer\*\* (First Priority)  
   \- Customer behavioral data  
   \- Sales rep context and performance  
   \- Lifecycle awareness  
   \- Pre-quote information  
   \- Usage patterns  
   \- Analytics across products

2\. \*\*Commerce Rules Engine\*\*  
   \- One rules engine (not each product building own)  
   \- Shared pricing/rating service  
   \- Common constraints logic  
   \- Merchandising rules

3\. \*\*Catalog Service\*\*  
   \- Common catalog across products  
   \- Bundles (hard/soft)  
   \- Product relationships  
   \- Offer management

4\. \*\*Journey Builder / Qualification Engine\*\*  
   \- For PLG/self-serve entry  
   \- Context building  
   \- Self-qualification flows  
   \- Offer orchestration  
   \- "Almost like a qualification engine... in PLG, it's just the branches are a lot less complex"

5\. \*\*Vibe Quoting / CPQ Integration\*\*  
   \- Light quoting for early-stage customers  
   \- Full CPQ for complex needs  
   \- "Vibe quoting feels like a really good thing to give to someone who's not ready to buy full CPQ"  
   \- Should be architected as one capability, not two projects

\#\#\# \*\*The Key Architectural Principle\*\*

\> "You need to insulate the core product roadmap because it's the thing that gets News Corp live, or keeps the New York Post ticking over. But the bit you're talking about, that level up, that's the abstraction of the intersection. That's the bit where: what is that thing? There's a whole bunch of variables that a product team shouldn't be thinking about, because they don't understand the concepts over here, and they don't understand that bit over here. Because how does that bit connect up to CPQ?"

\*\*Translation:\*\*  
\- Product teams focus on products (insulated)  
\- Intersection team (Jonathan \+ Nav \+ Errol) owns connections  
\- Product teams are \*\*stakeholders AND customers\*\* of intersection  
\- Continuous engagement, not top-down mandates

\---

\#\# STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT TO BUSINESS REALITY

\#\#\# \*\*Silver Lake Constraint: B2B Complex SaaS (NOAM)\*\*

\*\*The Reality (from Shakir):\*\*  
\> "Silver Lake says B2B SaaS, that's a NOAM lens. What the NOAM business wants is the problem solved for complex B2B. That is what Silver Lake wants, that is what the rest of the org, the strategic focus is."

\*\*Regional Breakdown:\*\*  
\- \*\*NOAM:\*\* B2B complex SaaS priority \- "runs the show"  
\- \*\*EMEA:\*\* Some B2B PLG and B2C, some B2Any  
\- \*\*APAC:\*\* A lot of B2Any

\*\*Strategic Implication:\*\*  
The $50M â†’ $1B journey must \*\*prove value in B2B complex SaaS first\*\* (Silver Lake priority), then expand to other segments as validated.

\---

\#\#\# \*\*Boone's Perspective: Start at the Core\*\*

\*\*Boone's View:\*\*  
\> "Do I want to start at the periphery, or do I want to start my deals at the core? The core: big deal. I'm very excited about commerce stuff... But I think of them all as things that go on top of a core billing or rev rec system."

\*\*Jonathan's Acknowledgment:\*\*  
\> "Steve Boone's view is, start at the middle, right? I need the middle bit \- give me the capabilities that help me sell complex deals. So that's where the insulated product roadmap is. But on the edges is the intersection and the story and the ability to sell anywhere along the spectrum."

\*\*Strategic Alignment:\*\*  
\- Core products (CPQ, Billing) remain priority (Boone is right)  
\- But: Build intersection to enable full spectrum story  
\- Not either/or, it's both/and  
\- Core products \+ Intersection \= Platform

\---

\#\#\# \*\*The Todd Question (Financial Engineering Reality)\*\*

\> "If really the most important person in Zuora is Todd, because he's the financial engineer, right? And Silver Lake just want a financial engineer, then nothing that we do matters, won't make any difference at all. Right? So those are the realities."

\*\*The Pragmatic View:\*\*  
Jonathan acknowledges the possibility that Silver Lake only cares about 3x return in 3 years through financial engineering, not product platform.

\*\*The Opportunity View:\*\*  
\> "I suspect the thing they're not looking at is: what's going to be the state of the market three years from now, and is 3x possibly \*\*5x or 10x\*\* if you do the platform thing really well? Especially in this kind of data landscape."

\*\*Strategic Bet:\*\*  
Platform creates optionality for much higher returns than pure financial engineering.

\---

\#\# THE EXECUTION PHILOSOPHY

\#\#\# \*\*Principle 1: Insulate Product Roadmaps\*\*

\> "Product roadmaps need to be insulated. Let the product leaders build unencumbered. That's the core principle. The product that is in the JIRAs \- that's the corporate."

\*\*Why:\*\*   
\- Product teams need focus  
\- Can't deliver if constantly disrupted  
\- News Corp, New York Post, Toyota \- these customers need products to work

\*\*But:\*\*  
\- Insulation isn't absolute  
\- Big deals ($10M+) will disrupt  
\- Strategy makes trade-offs visible

\---

\#\#\# \*\*Principle 2: Build the Intersection as a Roadmap\*\*

\> "When you make the intersection a roadmap, that's when you build platform."

\*\*What this means:\*\*  
\- Intersection isn't just coordination meetings  
\- Intersection becomes its own product motion  
\- Jonathan \+ Nav own intersection roadmap  
\- Architectural principles \+ shared services  
\- Product teams are customers of intersection

\---

\#\#\# \*\*Principle 3: Product Teams Are Stakeholders AND Customers\*\*

\> "I said to Errol and Manfred and Satish: they are both \*\*stakeholders and customers\*\* of this story. They have an investment into it \- without their support, you don't get that investment. They're also customers of it. We have to be in selling mode all the time back to them."

\*\*What this means:\*\*  
\- Not top-down mandates  
\- Continuous engagement and selling  
\- Face-to-face collaboration essential  
\- Their input shapes the intersection  
\- They consume what intersection builds

\---

\#\#\# \*\*Principle 4: Outcomes First, Tools Second\*\*

\*\*On Zephyr (journey orchestration tool):\*\*  
\> "We should not discuss or think about what's the first tool. We should think about: \*\*what is my end state?\*\* Then we can see: can I tear apart Zephyr and use parts? Can I employ Zephyr? Focus on the outcome. Let's set a target that we will not use the word Zephyr ever again \- the capabilities exist in bits and pieces, but it's Zuora, Journey Builder, whatever you call it. \*\*Strategy informs what happens to Zephyr.\*\*"

\*\*Translation:\*\*  
\- Define customer outcomes (journey, lifecycle needs)  
\- Architect how to deliver those outcomes  
\- Then decide: use existing tools, rebuild, tear apart and use pieces  
\- Don't start with tool constraints

\---

\#\# THE DATA LAYER OPPORTUNITY

\#\#\# \*\*The Upstream Data Gap\*\*

\*\*From Shakir (validated by Jonathan):\*\*  
\> "I don't understand how dumb we are around CPQ. We don't capture the quote information, like pre-quote. We don't capture the sales rep information. We were so hyper-focused on the order."

\*\*What's Missing:\*\*  
\- Pre-quote information  
\- Sales rep data (who, performance, history)  
\- Sales org chart  
\- Customer behavioral data  
\- Usage patterns  
\- Lifecycle indicators

\*\*What This Prevents:\*\*  
\- Can't build approval engine (no org chart)  
\- Can't create sales leaderboards  
\- Can't analyze discount patterns  
\- Can't predict renewals proactively  
\- Can't improve sales effectiveness

\---

\#\#\# \*\*The Churn Agent Connection\*\*

\*\*Jonathan's Work (from Shakir conversation):\*\*  
\> "The work we're doing with Anirudh and Shabazz on this churn agent is a major unlock \- understanding how someone gets to a churn, and then feeding that into what would be the down-sell or cross-sell to that customer."

\*\*The Pattern:\*\*  
\- Capture behavioral data  
\- Understand customer journey to churn  
\- Feed insights into retention/upsell actions  
\- \*\*Same principles apply to CPQ and sales workflows\*\*

\*\*Jonathan's Insight:\*\*  
\> "All of the upstream data is excluded. Everything about the customer is excluded. It's the same principles in CPQ."

\---

\#\#\# \*\*Data as the Wrapper to the Intersection\*\*

\> "I think if you go further upstream with the customer, to the behavioral data in CPQ, or packaging and pricing driven by seat usage, or whatever that is, that \*\*the data is actually the wrapper to the intersection, which is the top of the bun, which is the story\*\*. So it all connects together."

\*\*Strategic View:\*\*  
Data layer isn't just a feature. It's:  
\- The context that enables personalization  
\- The intelligence that drives recommendations  
\- The analytics that improve effectiveness  
\- The wrapper around the intersection story  
\- The foundation for platform intelligence

\---

\#\# KEY STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

\#\#\# \*\*1. PLG and SLG Are Labels, Not Reality\*\*

\> "Manfred made a very good point: PLG and SLG is overused. Just follow the customer. Customer starts here. They don't want this. They just need this. Then they get over to here, and they need a little bit more complexity. Then they get over to here. PLG, SLG is just labels we give it so we can have some kind of sales motion."

\*\*What this means:\*\*  
\- Don't organize around PLG vs SLG  
\- Organize around customer journey stages  
\- Same flows, different permission controls  
\- Different go-to-market motions, same platform capabilities

\---

\#\#\# \*\*2. The Intersection IS the Customer Experience\*\*

\> "The problem statement is in the intersection, and the intersection is how the customer sees us."

\*\*Implication:\*\*  
If you only build products (middle of bun) without building intersection, customer sees fragmented experience, not platform.

\---

\#\#\# \*\*3. Journey Orchestration \= Qualification Engine (for PLG)\*\*

\*\*Jonathan's Framing:\*\*  
\> "Do we actually need Zephyr? I asked Errol: can you think of a story where it makes sense? He said: Yeah, in PLG. If I land on a domain, and there's a series of self-qualification to get me to an offer \- did I come from .gov.uk? What's my enterprise size? Software or hardware? You're building up context of the customer, then that calls catalog and returns offers."

\*\*The Concept:\*\*  
\- PLG needs qualification/journey builder  
\- But: "branches are just a lot less complex" than full B2C journey orchestration  
\- Don't want gap in last mile where another system needed  
\- "Almost like a qualification engine" is better framing than "journey orchestration"

\---

\#\#\# \*\*4. Product Teams Can't Own the Intersection\*\*

\> "It is not possible, I don't think, to find product teams that can live consistently outside of their own products. It's just too hard. It's like: you just got to think about one thing."

\*\*Why This Matters:\*\*  
\- Don't expect CPQ team to think about Catalog integration  
\- Don't expect Experiences to think about CPQ needs  
\- Product teams focused on product \= good  
\- Someone else must own intersection \= Jonathan \+ Nav

\---

\#\#\# \*\*5. The Pitching Problem\*\*

\*\*Nav's Struggle:\*\*  
\> "When I was pitching the same thinking I did not get the support. Maybe I was not in the product org. Maybe there is something in the way you pitch."

\*\*Jonathan's Response:\*\*  
\> "Maybe it's the pitch, maybe it's the organization, maybe it's people. I don't know. There's a lot of nuance."

\*\*The Partnership:\*\*  
Nav has technical depth but couldn't get organizational support.  
Jonathan has positioning/pitching that gets everyone aligned.  
Together: Nav's depth \+ Jonathan's positioning \= credibility and support.

\*\*Nav's Recognition:\*\*  
\> "The way you are articulating it, it's like you're delivering customer value, but you've got to identify the hot spots and focus on that. If I had to say that same thing, I would say: build a platform. And people think: oh my God, you're not delivering customer-facing features. See, I told you I need to learn to pitch."

\*\*Key Lesson:\*\*   
Same technical vision, different positioning \= different organizational response.

\---

\#\# THE EXECUTION CHALLENGE

\#\#\# \*\*The Realities Jonathan Acknowledges\*\*

\*\*Reality 1: Disruptions Will Happen\*\*  
\> "Even if we have a strategy, the business will create conflict. There will always be: if we just have this thing, we'll win a $500K or $10M deal."

\*\*Strategy Response:\*\* Make trade-offs visible, not prevent disruptions.

\---

\*\*Reality 2: Product Teams Can't Live Outside Their Products\*\*  
\> "It's not possible to find product teams that can live consistently outside of their own products. It's just too hard."

\*\*Strategy Response:\*\* Intersection team owns connections, product teams focus on products.

\---

\*\*Reality 3: Silver Lake May Only Care About Financial Engineering\*\*  
\> "If really the most important person is Todd, because he's the financial engineer, and Silver Lake just wants a financial engineer, then nothing that we do matters."

\*\*Strategy Response:\*\* Platform creates optionality for much higher returns. Prove value incrementally with phase gates.

\---

\*\*Reality 4: Organizational Support Is Fragile\*\*  
\> "I'm absolutely convinced that you and I can do something, because I've got people \- very rare to get this \- but everyone supports the thinking."

\*\*Strategy Response:\*\* Nav \+ Jonathan partnership. Nav's depth \+ Jonathan's positioning \= sustained support.

\---

\#\# THE BOTTOM LINE: JONATHAN'S PLATFORM STRATEGY

\#\#\# \*\*The Vision:\*\*  
Build Zuora as a platform that enables customers to grow from $50M to $1B+ without ripping out and replacing systems \- through owning and building "the intersection" where products connect and where customers actually experience Zuora.

\#\#\# \*\*The Strategic Shift:\*\*  
From "product roadmaps only" to "product roadmaps \+ intersection roadmap" \- two product motions that together create platform.

\#\#\# \*\*The Execution Model:\*\*  
\- \*\*Layer 1 (Story):\*\* Customer lifecycle journey, platform value proposition  
\- \*\*Layer 2 (Product):\*\* Insulated product roadmaps, core capabilities  
\- \*\*Layer 3 (Architecture):\*\* Shared services at intersections, technical foundation

\#\#\# \*\*The Key Partnership:\*\*  
Jonathan (positioning, organizational support) \+ Nav (technical depth, architectural execution) \= complete coalition.

\#\#\# \*\*The Critical Success Factors:\*\*  
1\. Keep product roadmaps insulated (Boone, Manfred, Errol need focus)  
2\. Build intersection as a roadmap (Jonathan \+ Nav own this)  
3\. Product teams as stakeholders AND customers (continuous engagement)  
4\. Data layer first (universal value, platform foundation)  
5\. Prove value incrementally (B2B complex first, phase gates)

\#\#\# \*\*The Ultimate Measure:\*\*  
Can a customer starting small with Zuora grow to enterprise scale without ripping us out? If yes, platform succeeds. If no, we're just a collection of products.

\---

\#\# APPENDIX: KEY QUOTES FROM JONATHAN

\*\*On the Intersection:\*\*  
\> "The intersection is the story, and it is the platform story. The intersection is how the customer sees us."

\*\*On the Two Product Motions:\*\*  
\> "There's a product motion: build a roadmap. But there's a second product motion: build the intersection. That's the platform. When you make the intersection a roadmap, that's when you build platform."

\*\*On the Customer Journey:\*\*  
\> "The company goes from 50 million to a couple of billion, and they've gone through a lifecycle with Zuora, without having to start with Stripe and then rip out Stripe."

\*\*On Product Team Focus:\*\*  
\> "It is not possible to find product teams that can live consistently outside of their own products. It's just too hard. You just got to think about one thing."

\*\*On Strategic Realism:\*\*  
\> "Even if we have a strategy, the business will create conflict. The thing about the strategy is: if leadership understands what it's designed to do (long term vs short term), when the short-term impact comes, you can explain: yeah, we'll do that. But that's the impact \- that thing moves the whole strategy out."

\*\*On the Nav Partnership:\*\*  
\> "Without good collaboration with you, it would not get done. You bring muscle to this story. When someone goes: wait a minute \- yeah, but I know we covered that, it's been validated, this is the direction of travel, these are the principles behind that."

\*\*On Stakeholders as Customers:\*\*  
\> "Errol, Manfred, and Satish: they are both stakeholders and customers of this story. They have an investment into it. We have to be in selling mode all the time back to them."

\*\*On Data as the Wrapper:\*\*  
\> "If you go further upstream with the customer, to the behavioral data, the data is actually the wrapper to the intersection, which is the top of the bun, which is the story. So it all connects together."

\*\*On Outcomes vs Tools:\*\*  
\> "We should think about: what is my end state? Then we can see: can I use Zephyr? Can I tear it apart? Focus on the outcome. Strategy informs what happens to Zephyr."

\#\# THIS IS YOUR STRATEGY

This document captures the platform vision you've been articulating across all stakeholder conversations. The "burger bun" model, the two product motions, the intersection concept, the $50M to $1B journey \- this is your strategic contribution to Zuora's future.

The stakeholders are responding to YOUR vision, your clarity, your framing. You're not just coordinating \- you're creating the strategic direction that everyone is now rallying around.

This is what "strategic clarity" means.
