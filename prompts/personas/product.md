# Product Manager Persona - Roadmap Formatting

You are reformatting a product roadmap for a **product management audience** (PMs, product leaders, program managers).

## Audience Needs

Product managers need to:
- Understand priorities and sequencing
- See clear user value propositions
- Know success metrics and validation criteria
- Understand dependencies between features
- Communicate plans to their teams and stakeholders
- Plan discovery, design, and delivery work

## Output Requirements

### Length
2-3 pages (detailed but scannable)

### Structure

1. **Strategic Context** (1 paragraph)
   - High-level strategic direction
   - How this roadmap connects to company goals

2. **Priorities & Rationale**
   For each major feature/initiative:
   - **Feature Name & Description**
   - **User Value**: Who benefits and how? What problem does this solve?
   - **Business Value**: Revenue, retention, efficiency, strategic positioning
   - **Success Metrics**: How will we measure success?
   - **Effort Estimate**: T-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL) or story points if available
   - **Timeline**: Quarter or month-based
   - **Dependencies**: What must be done first? What blocks this?
   - **Risks & Assumptions**: What could go wrong? What are we assuming?

3. **Sequencing & Dependencies**
   - Visual or textual dependency map
   - What must happen first?
   - What can run in parallel?
   - Critical path items

4. **Success Criteria**
   - Key metrics to track
   - Validation milestones
   - How we'll know if we're on track

5. **Stakeholder Talking Points**
   - Key messages for different audiences
   - How to explain prioritization decisions
   - Talking points for common questions

## Tone & Style

- **Practical and actionable**: PMs need to execute on this
- **User-centric**: Lead with user value, not technical capabilities
- **Clear on priorities**: Explain the "why" behind sequencing
- **Transparent on trade-offs**: Help PMs defend choices
- **Metric-driven**: Include specific success criteria

## What to Include

✅ User stories and value propositions
✅ Success metrics and KPIs
✅ T-shirt sizing or effort estimates
✅ Dependencies and blockers
✅ Risks and assumptions
✅ Timeline in quarters or months
✅ Validation milestones
✅ Acceptance criteria (high-level)

## What to Exclude

❌ Low-level technical implementation
❌ Code architecture details
❌ Detailed API specifications
❌ Internal engineering decisions (unless they impact PM planning)

## Feature Template

Use this format for each major feature:

### [Feature Name]
**Timeline**: Q2 2026
**Effort**: M (Medium - 4-6 weeks)

**User Value**: [2-3 sentences on who benefits and how]

**Business Value**: [Expected impact - revenue, retention, efficiency]

**Success Metrics**:
- Primary: [e.g., Increase conversion by 15%]
- Secondary: [e.g., Reduce support tickets by 20%]

**Dependencies**:
- Requires: [What must be done first]
- Blocks: [What is waiting on this]

**Assumptions & Risks**:
- Assumes: [Key assumptions]
- Risks: [What could go wrong]

## Example Framing

Instead of: "Build recommendation engine"
Say: "**Personalized Product Recommendations** - Help users discover relevant products through ML-powered suggestions, increasing average order value by 20% and reducing time-to-purchase."

Now, reformat the master roadmap for the product management audience following these guidelines.
