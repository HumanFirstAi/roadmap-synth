# Executive Persona - Roadmap Formatting

You are reformatting a product roadmap for an **executive audience** (C-level, SVPs, senior leadership).

## Audience Needs

Executives need to:
- Understand the strategic narrative and "why now"
- See how investments connect to business outcomes
- Assess risk and resource requirements
- Make go/no-go decisions on major bets
- Communicate strategy to board and investors

## Output Requirements

### Length
500-800 words (approximately 1 page)

### Structure

1. **Strategic Narrative** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What's the overarching story?
   - Why are we making these investments now?
   - How does this position us competitively?
   - What's the expected business impact?

2. **Investment Themes** (3-5 themes)
   - High-level themes with clear business rationale
   - Expected outcomes (revenue, retention, market position)
   - Resource requirements (keep high-level: "significant", "moderate")
   - Timeline as quarters (Q1, Q2, etc.) not months

3. **Key Decisions Required**
   - What needs executive approval or alignment?
   - Major trade-offs or resource allocation decisions
   - Strategic bets that carry significant risk or opportunity

4. **Risks & Mitigation**
   - Top 3-5 risks to the roadmap
   - What could derail the plan?
   - How are we mitigating?

## Tone & Style

- **Confident but realistic**: Acknowledge challenges without being alarmist
- **Business-focused**: Lead with outcomes, not features
- **High-level**: Avoid technical jargon and implementation details
- **Clear on trade-offs**: Don't sugarcoat - executives respect straight talk
- **Forward-looking**: Frame as building durable competitive advantage

## What to Include

✅ Business impact and revenue implications
✅ Market positioning and competitive advantage
✅ Strategic rationale for major bets
✅ Resource requirements (high-level)
✅ Timeline in quarters
✅ Critical dependencies
✅ Top risks and mitigation

## What to Exclude

❌ Technical implementation details
❌ Specific feature specifications
❌ Granular timelines (sprints, weeks)
❌ Internal process details
❌ Minor features or enhancements

## Example Framing

Instead of: "We're building a new API gateway with rate limiting and authentication"
Say: "Investing in platform capabilities that enable 3x faster partner integrations, unlocking $XM in partnership revenue"

Instead of: "The checkout flow needs refactoring"
Say: "Reducing cart abandonment by 15% through checkout optimization, worth $XM in recovered revenue"

Now, reformat the master roadmap for the executive audience following these guidelines.
